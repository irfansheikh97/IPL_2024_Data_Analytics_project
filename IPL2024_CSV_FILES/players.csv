Abhishek Sharma,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/358000/358037.png",Sunrisers Hyderabad,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Allrounder,"Abhishek Sharma IPL factfile- Abhishek Sharma was signed by Delhi Daredevils as a 17-year-old in 2018, a week before India's Under-19 squad, of which he was a part, won the World Cup in New Zealand.- He blitzed 46 off 19 balls on his IPL debut against RCB but spent only one season at Delhi, before joining Sunrisers Hyderabad in 2019, where he has remained ever since.- In IPL 2024, Abhishek smashed the fastest IPL fifty for Sunrisers, off 16 balls, as they amassed the highest total in IPL history - 277 - against Mumbai Indians.Abhishek Sharma player profileA clean striker of the ball with a solid game against pace and spin, Abhishek Sharma started off in the middle order but made a smooth transition to the top three for Punjab in domestic cricket and for Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL. He's also a handy left-arm spinner who can surprise batters with his backspinning legcutter.He made a name for himself in age-group cricket, first as the leading run-scorer in the Vijay Merchant domestic Under-16 tournament in 2015-16 (where he made an incredible 1200 runs in seven matches), and the next season as India's captain when they won the U-19 Asia Cup title. He also was an integral part of India's U-19 World Cup-winning squad in 2018, scoring 50 and taking 2 for 11 against Bangladesh in the quarter-final.Delhi Daredevils picked him up in the 2018 auction and he smashed 46 off 19 balls in his first IPL game, but lost momentum for a few seasons after that. In 2022, in his fourth season with Sunrisers Hyderabad, Abhishek, now settled in the top order, scored 426 runs at a strike rate of 133. Most memorably, he took 34 off 15 Rashid Khan deliveries in a match against eventual champions Gujarat Titans. A year later, he made 485 runs, with two hundreds and three half-centuries while striking at over 180, as Punjab won their first Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 trophy. Earlier in the tournament, his 112 off 51 balls against Andhra Pradesh powered Punjab to 275 for 6, a tournament record.Another record total followed in the 2024 IPL when he smashed 63 off 23 balls taking Sunrisers to 277 for 3, the highest in IPL history. Still, Abhishek isn't just a limited-overs prospect. On his Ranji Trophy debut in 2017, he scored 94 from No. 8, and In December 2022 he made his first first-class hundred in a draw against Chandigarh."
Travis Head,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/321500/321584.png",Sunrisers Hyderabad,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Top order Batter,"A talented, aggressive left-hand batter earmarked for big things at a young age, it was Travis Head's second coming as an international cricketer where his career really took off. In late 2021 he was recalled for the Ashes series and made a match-defining 85-ball century at the Gabba - it set the tone for a strong of destructive Test innings while he also reemerged as a white-ball force, so central to Australia's 2023 ODI World Cup plans that they waited for him to recover from a broken hand. In the final against India he made 137 off 120 balls. A cult hero was born.Head earned his first call-up to Australia's squad at the age of 22 for a series of T20Is against India in early 2016 and it was initially the white-ball game where he established himself before Test cricket took over following a debut in 2018. He had made his Sheffield Shield debut at the age of 18 in the 2011-12 season and over the next few summers he established his place in the South Australia batting line-up and was a consistent contributor. In February 2015, Head became their youngest captain at the age of 21. He had been viewed as a future leader ever since he captained South Australia to the Under-19 National Championship title in 2012-13 and was named Player of the Championship. As captain of South Australia he showed maturity beyond his years, and in 2015-16 steered them to their first Sheffield Shield final in 20 years.In 2018 he earned his first Test call-up of part of a new look Australia side which faced Pakistan in the UAE. He played 16 consecutive Tests, scoring a maiden hundred against Sri Lanka in Canberra, before missing the final match of the Ashes series but returned for the home season and notched a second ton in the Boxing Day Test against New Zealand.He was dropped again midway through the 2020-21 series against India but remained prolific at domestic level. The following season he was preferred ahead of Usman Khawaja for the final middle-order spot and would go on to claim the Compton-Miller medal as Player of the Series despite missing the Sydney Test with Covid. He found life tougher on the subcontinent but it was still a surprising decision to omit him for the first Test against India in early 2023. The absence lasted one match and he was elevated to open the batting. Back in his traditional middle-order role away from Asia, he continued the trend of match-defining centuries with a brilliant 163 in the World Test Championship final against India at The Oval. Later that year he would have two medals around his neck.

After his father was transferred to Pune in the course of his service, Tripathi cut his teeth at Deccan Gymkhana, one of the oldest clubs in the city, and got his start in domestic cricket with Maharashtra in 2012.  In the two seasons starting 2014-15, he made just north of 1000 runs for them at 40 from 17 games. A few seasons on, he was the side's top scorer in the Ranji Trophy in 2018-19, with 504 runs.Tripathi's IPL career began with Rising Pune Supergiant in 2017, when he came into the tournament fresh off smashing 157 runs in three innings in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, and produced seven scores of over 30 in eight innings on the trot. After a capable if not spectacular season at Rajasthan Royals and two more of the same with Kolkata Knight Riders, he took it up a gear for Sunrisers Hyderabad in 2022, with six scores of 30-plus."
Aiden Markram,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/322000/322067.png",Sunrisers Hyderabad,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Opening Batter,"The first South Africa captain to win a World Cup, albeit at age-group level, Aiden Markram announced himself as champion material early. He led South Africa's Under-19s to World Cup glory in 2014 and was also their leading run-scorer and third overall. It took him another three years to break into the senior side, but when he did, he made an impact right away with 97, 143 and 125 in his first three Tests, at home against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. He did well against tougher opposition as well, making 94 in a comprehensive win over India in Centurion in January 2018 and two big hundreds against Australia in the contentious Sandpapergate series two months later. But overseas success took a while to come - after disappointing tours of India and Sri Lanka, Markram made his first away Test hundred in a second-innings effort in Rawalpindi in February 2021, showing he had the technique to navigate pitches that turned and stayed low. His 108 gave South Africa a fighting chance, but they eventually lost the series 2-0. A batter of class and composure, aggressive and strong on the off side, Markram did well in limited-overs cricket as well. In 2021, he was South Africa's leading run-maker in ODIs, had a stellar T20 World Cup,  and was named the T20I Player of the Year in Cricket South Africa's awards for the year."

His 1237 runs there at an average of 176.41 still remains the record highest tally in the tournament's history, and earned him the BCCI's award for best U-16 cricketer that season. As he developed his bowling as a seamer, he also took the new ball for Andhra in senior domestic cricket, and his all-round skills earned the interest of Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL. Before the 2023 IPL season, he was bought by SRH for INR 20 lakhs, but in his debut season, bowled five wicketless overs across two games while not getting to bat. However, in IPL 2024, his exploits earned SRH crucial victories in their run to the playoffs; his 64 against Punjab Kings helped SRH win by one run, while his unbeaten 76 against Delhi Capitals ensured a two-run win.

Schooled at Menlopark High School and the University of Pretoria, Klaasen made his first-class debut for Northerns in the 2012-13 season and averaged 42.58 in the provincial three-day cup. He scored his first franchise hundred in February 2017: 195 to help Titans beat Dolphins in the penultimate round of the first-class competition.Klaasen made 69 off 30 balls in his second T20I, against India in Centurion in 2018. His first international hundred also came at home, an unbeaten 123 in a big one-day win over Australia in Paarl two years on. In 2023, he stunned the same opposition with a breathtaking display of power-hitting in Centurion to score 174 off 83 balls - the second-highest individual score by a batter playing at No. 5 or lower in ODIs.His phenomenal numbers against slow bowling - he struck at 191 and averaged 132 against spin in the 2023 IPL - have made him a valuable player among T20 franchises. Klaasen made his Test debut in 2019, but opportunities in the format have been few and far between. He got his first national contract in 2021, shortly after captaining a second-string T20I side in Pakistan."

The bowler who emerged in 2017 was a thoroughbred quick who became one of the standout players in the world and, in late 2021, Australia's Test captain in dramatic circumstances. By 2023 he had led the team to the World Test Championship and ODI World Cup.Cummins burst onto the scene with a sensational Test debut, taking a match total of seven wickets to set up a thrilling two-wicket win to square the series against South Africa at the Wanderers. He had made his debut for New South Wales during the 2010-11 season and was particularly impressive in his maiden Big Bash season. Touted to be a future leader of Australia's pace attack, he was offered a central contract for 2011-12, becoming the youngest player to be contracted since the current system was introduced in 1998.Then came the injuries. He suffered repeated stress fractures in his lower back and did not play another Test for six years, until the 2017 tour of India. But all the pain and rehab of those intervening years appeared to have been worthwhile as his body toughened up to the rigours of international cricket.In the wake of Australia's ball-tampering scandal he became arguably the nation's shining light in a cricketing sense. He was absent through the various 2018 winter tours immediately after the controversy due to a back injury but was monumental in the losing home series against India and was subsequently rewarded with the Test vice-captaincy against Sri Lanka. He became the No. 1 ranked Test bowler in the world and claimed Australia's coveted Allan Border Medal as the 2018-19 men's cricketer of the year. He was immense during the 2019 Ashes in England and through another home series defeat against India in 2020-21, typified by a relentlessness with ball in hand and tremendous stamina.Having been identified as a future captain, his rise to the position came earlier than expected when Tim Paine resigned shortly before the 2021-22 Ashes. However, in a mark of the cricketer and leader Cummins had become it was, given the circumstances, almost a seamless transition. A few months later he had retained the Ashes and secured victory in Pakistan on Australia's first tour of the country in 24 years.His capacity to learn on the job was highlighted by his success in the ODI role and how he galvanised Australia following a poor start to the 2023 World Cup in India. His dismissal of Virat Kohli in the final silenced a nation.
ESPNcricinfo staffPat Cummins IPL factfile- For one season, Pat Cummins held the record for the fastest fifty in IPL - jointly with KL Rahul - after he got to the mark in 14 balls when playing for Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) against Mumbai Indians (MI) in 2022. Cummins' record was broken by Rajasthan Royals' (RR) Yashasvi Jaiswal in 2023 by one ball.- For a little under two hours, Cummins was the most expensive player procured at an IPL auction when he was sold to Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) for INR 20.50 crore (US$2.47 million approx.) in the auction held a month after he had led Australia to the 2023 ODI World Cup title.- At the same auction, compatriot Mitchell Starc shattered the record when he attracted a winning bid of INR 24.75 crore (US$2.98 million approx.) from Cummins' former team, KKR.- Cummins went on to become the second Australian to lead SRH - after David Warner - despite never having captained any side in a senior T20 competition before.- He was the third Australian captain of an IPL team from Hyderabad. Both Adam Gilchrist, who led Deccan Chargers, and Warner delivered IPL titles before Cummins."
Jaydev Unadkat,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/322600/322698.png",Sunrisers Hyderabad,Right hand Bat,Left arm Medium,Bowler,"A left-arm fast bowler, Jaydev Unadkat led India Under-19s' attack in the 2010 World Cup in New Zealand. He was first spotted at the  Duleep Sinh School of Cricket in Porbandar, where he impressed his coach Ram Odedra with his bowling action and ability to land the ball on the seam. After the World Cup, Unadkat was handed an IPL contract with Kolkata Knight Riders and he impressed the bowling coach Wasim Akram, who identified him as one for the future. He was picked for India A's tour of England in June 2010 and had a dream first-class debut, taking a match-winning 13 for 103 against West Indies A at Grace Road. A month later, he joined the Indian Test squad in Sri Lanka as a nets bowler and was included in the squad for the year-end tour of South Africa, where he made his Test debut at Centurion. However, it was a forgettable one, as he went wicketless in 26 overs for 101 runs. He was duly dropped from the Test team, and made a return to the domestic circuit. A significant breakthrough came during India's A tour of New Zealand in 2012-13, where he picked up nine List-A wickets at an average of 15.77 with two four-wicket hauls. He then enjoyed a largely successful campaign with Royal Challengers Bangalore, finishing joint-second on the team's wicket-takers list. His consistent performances helped him gain selection for India's tour of Zimbabwe in July 2013, where he made his ODI debut. It proved a largely successful trip, as he picked up eight wickets in five matches. He later played two more ODIs in the upcoming home season - against Australia and West Indies - but went wicketless in both.He spent a considerable time off the field due to a stress fracture he picked up in 2014 and came back in the 2015-16 Ranji Trophy season with as many as 40 wickets that included four five-wicket hauls to charge Saurashtra to the finals. He reveled in the semi-finals with 11 wickets against Assam, days after he was picked by Kolkata Knight Riders for INR 1.6 crore in the IPL auction in February 2016.

Bhuvneshwar Kumar,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316658.png",Sunrisers Hyderabad,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Bowler,"At the time of his India debut in 2012, Bhuvneshwar Kumar seemed the answer to the side's fast-bowling scarcity; though middling in pace, he produced swing both ways and had a devastating inswinger. In his first T20I over, he bowled Nasir Jamshed; with his first ODI delivery, he bowled Mohammad Hafeez; and in his first Test series he played a part in India's first whitewash win in a four-Test series, against Australia in 2013.Â Bhuvneshwar demonstrated his mastery of line and length early, when at 19 he worked Sachin Tendulkar over for his first duck in domestic first-class cricket, in the 2008-09 Ranji Trophy final. He was handy with the bat too - in the 2012-13 Duleep Trophy semi-final he scored 128 batting at No. 8.Â He was one of the lone bright spots on India's otherwise wretched tour of England in 2014, taking 19 wickets - including 6 for 82 in the win at Lord's -Â at 26.63. However, an ankle injury in Australia put him out of commission for most of the next year, and he played just one game in the 2015 ODI World Cup. When he returned he wasn't quite the same bowler - he had traded swing for increased pace, but not always effectively. Despite two more five-fors in 2016, against West Indies away and New Zealand at home, his appearances in Tests became more sporadic as injuries dogged him, and he played his last series against South Africa in 2018.Â It was in white-ball cricket that Bhuvneshwar found his niche. In 2013, six months into his ODI career, he picked up 4 for 8 against Sri Lanka in a tri-series game in the Caribbean, and finished as the leading wicket-taker with ten wickets in four games. By 2017 he had formed a devastating partnership with Jasprit Bumrah, and developed slower balls and yorkers that made him India's go-to bowler at the death. In February 2018, he became the second Indian bowler after Yuzvendra Chahal to take five wickets in a T20I, against South Africa in Johannesburg. In 2022, he went one better, picking up 5 for 4 against Afghanistan in the Asia Cup.Â Bhuvneshwar's rise in white-ball cricket mirrored his success in the IPL. He was handed a contract by Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2009 but went two seasons without playing a game in the tournament. After another three unremarkable seasons with Pune Warriors, he was signed by Sunrisers Hyderabad in 2014, and quickly rose through the ranks to become the lynchpin of their powerplay and death bowling. He took upwards of 18 wickets in each of his first four seasons, won the purple cap two years in a row, in 2016 and 2017, and was instrumental in Sunrisers' only title win, in 2016. Though his performances tapered off in later seasons, he remains the franchise's all-time leading wicket-taker."

Narine got his call-up to the Trinidad and Tobago squad in 2009 after he took all ten wickets in a trial game. Two years later came his first big outing, when he was one of three bowlers to take ten or more wickets at the 2011 Champions League Twenty20 for T&T. In 2012, he helped take West Indies to the World T20 title, the first time they claimed a global trophy since 1979.Narine has been a fixture for Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL since 2012 - one of a handful of players to have only played for one franchise in the competition. He was among the chief architects of the side's two title victories, in 2012 and 2014, taking over 20 wickets apiece in both seasons. In the first half of his career with them, Narine was untouchable: in 2016, with more than 650 overs bowled for KKR, he had 216 wickets at an economy rate of 5.52. Such highs were beyond him in Test cricket, though. The last of his six matches for West Indies came in December 2013 and his bowling average in the format remains a dismal 40-plus.Perhaps no other spinners save for Saeed Ajmal and Muthiah Muralidaran have been dogged by trouble over the legitimacy of their bowling actions as much as Narine has. Before his ODI debut, in India in 2011, he needed to rework his action with the help of biomechanics experts at the University of Western Australia. In 2014 he missed out on playing the Champions League T20 final after being suspended for throwing. He withdrew himself from the ODI World Cup the following year, saying he needed to keep working on his action, but when he did return, he was suspended from bowling in international cricket after he was reported during a game against Sri Lanka in November 2015. He was cleared a few months later but missed the 2016 T20 World Cup. He was reported yet again during the PSL in 2018, cleared, then reported again in the 2020 IPL, and subsequently cleared once more.In the second half of the 2010s, attention was cast on quite another aspect of Narine's game - his batting. Melbourne Renegades sent him in as opener that BBL season, and he delivered, then taking on the role in other leagues as well. In 2017, he produced 502 runs at a strike rate of over 150 across five T20 leagues and in T20Is.Sunil Narine IPL factfile- Sunil Narine has been a part of the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) squad ever since he was signed by them ahead of IPL 2012- Narine was crucial in KKR's title wins in 2012 and 2014, taking 24 and 21 wickets in those seasons.- Narine is the highest wicket-taker in the Indian Premier League among overseas spinners, and was one of the first mystery spinners in the IPL- Narine has also opened the innings frequently for KKR as a pinch-hitter. His partnership record of scoring 105 runs with Chris Lynn in the powerplay still stands.- In IPL 2024, he became the first player to score 500 runs and take 15 wickets in a season."

Iyer left DC at the end of that season and began his KKR career the following year.Shreyas Iyer player profileShreyas Iyer is an attacking top-order batter capable of marrying classical shots with brute force.  He made headlines when Delhi Daredevils bought him at the 2015 IPL auction for Rs 2.6 crore (about US$416,000). It was faith he repaid with interest: he made 439 runs that season, and won the IPL Emerging Player of the Year award. Over the next six seasons, he became a mainstay of the side and its captain, making over 400 runs a season for them four times. Iyer came up through the Under-19 ranks, hitting back-to-back fifties in the 2014 World Cup playoffs to help India finish fifth. He made his first-class debut for Mumbai the next domestic season, and after a lukewarm stint in the middle order, was promoted to opener and finished as the team's top run-getter with 809 runs at an average of over 50. He had a blow-out Ranji Trophy season the next year, with 1321 runs at 73, and made a century in the final, where Mumbai won their 41st title.By then calls for Iyer to be fast-tracked into the India side had grown clamorous, but it took nearly another two years before he made his international debut, in the white-ball formats first. His first hundred for India came in an ODI against New Zealand in Hamilton in 2020, and he made a century and fifty on Test debut against the same side a little over a year and a half later, this time at home. In a Ranchi ODI in October 2022, he made a chase of 282 against South Africa look like a walk in a park with a well-paced unbeaten 113 that took India home with plenty of room to spare."

So his IPL career only really started and flourished at KKR, who gave him a debut in 2018."

A batter who hits the ball hard enough to make it scream for mercy, he functions primarily as a finisher. He generates fair pace and bounce with the ball in hand and when it is anywhere near him in the field, it doesn't matter at what speed it's travelling; Russell will probably get to it. He is less a cricketer, in the traditional sense, than an athlete.He first came to notice with his exploits in a 50-over game against Ireland in June 2010, smashing 61 off 34 balls and taking 6 for 42. It was a performance that helped him win a place in West Indies' 2011 World Cup squad. Things didn't go to plan in that tournament, but Russell's capabilities were on show against newly crowned champions India in June when he came out at No. 9, with the score at 96 for 7, and smashed 92 off 64 balls.His impact in international cricket was somewhat sporadic until 2015, when, against South Africa in Port Elizabeth, he provided a consolation victory for West Indies on a difficult tour by hitting 64 off 40 balls to chase down 263 with one wicket to spare. Russell's skills were evident in domestic T20 cricket all along. He had a ground-breaking CPL in 2013 when his team Jamaica Tallawahs became champions. Just as he was reaching stratospheric heights, he served time on the sidelines, when the Jamaica Anti-Doping Commission charged him for not making himself available for drug tests on three occasions in 2015, an offence tantamount to one failed test. Russell was found guilty of a whereabouts-clause violation and banned for a year by an independent doping panel in Jamaica for most of 2017.His star shone brightest at the IPL in 2015, when he was named Player of the Series, and in the Big Bash League later that year, when he struck at 186.86 and picked up 16 wickets - joint-second best - from ten matches. He won the CPL with Tallawahs in 2013, the IPL with Kolkata Knight Riders in 2014, the Bangladesh Premier League with Comilla Victorians, the BBL with Sydney Thunder, and the Pakistan Super League title with Islamabad United in 2016.Andre Russell IPL factfile- Andre Russell made his IPL debut in 2012, for Delhi Daredevils (now Capitals). He played seven matches across two seasons without doing much of note.- Russell has been with Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) since 2014 (save for 2017, when he was sidelined, serving a doping ban) and they won their second IPL title in his first season with them- He has developed into a fearsome lower-order hitter and scored over 2400 runs for KKR at a strike rate of more than 170.- Russell's bustling, hit-the-deck bowling has been an asset for Knight Riders over the years. He has taken more than 100 wickets for them.- Russell has made over 300 runs in an IPL season four times, in 2015 (326 runs), 2018 (316), 2019 (510) and 2022 (335).- He was formidable in the 2022 season, taking 17 wickets to go with his 300-plus runs from 14 games. However, KKR had a disappointing season, finishing seventh.- Russell played his 100th game for Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2023 season."

A left-armer called Mitchell has been a staple of Australia's attack for more than a decade and seems set to remain so for the foreseeable future. While Johnson was more express, Starc is still quick enough to make life uncomfortable for opposition batsmen, especially with the bounce gained from his 1.96m height - and boasts greater control of swing than his former colleague. Never was that shown to greater effect than during the 2015 World Cup, when Starc was at times unplayable, his inswingers rattling stumps and trapping batsmen in front throughout the competition. Not surprisingly he was named Player of the Tournament for his 22 victims at 10.18, and four years later he would claim 27 wickets at the World Cup in England when Australia's defence ended in the semi-finals.His challenge has been to take that white-ball form and perform just as consistently with the red ball, although overall his Test career numbers are also outstanding. He struggled to gain the consistent backing of the selectors early in his Test career and was often in one Test and out the next, but in 2015 he finally enjoyed a solid run of Test cricket until an ankle injury stopped him during the home summer. His career-best match haul of 11 for 94 came in the notable surroundings of Galle - albeit in an Australia defeat - and he claimed 22 wickets in four Tests during the 2017-18 Ashes. He took his 200th Test wicket in his 50th Test in February of 2019 joining an elite group of Australian bowlers although play only one of the five Ashes Tests in the 2019 series. When England toured down under in 2021-22, Starc produced some of his best form in the three matches where the series was decided and went on to claim the Allan Border Medal as Australia's male player of the year.Also a powerful lower-order batter, Starc fell one short of a Test century in Mohali in 2013. He is married to Australia wicketkeeper Alyssa Healy.ESPNcricinfo staff Mitchell Starc IPL factfile- As of 2024, Mitchell Starc was the costliest player procured at an IPL auction when Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) made a successful bid of INR 24.75 crore (US$ 2.98 million approx.) for him at the auction before the 2024 IPL.- One of the most sought-after players in T20 cricket, Starc had played only 27 matches across the first 15 editions of the IPL, with injuries, international commitments, and personal reasons kept keeping him away at various points.- In the two IPLs that Starc played before KKR got him for 2024, he took 14 and 20 wickets for Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), in 2014 and 2015."

At 12, Jaiswal moved from rural Uttar Pradesh to Mumbai for cricket. He slept in tents and sold pani puri to earn pocket money. When Jwala Singh, a local coach, took him under his wing two years later, after watching him at Azad Maidan, Jaiswal's career began to take off.In October 2019, in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, the 50-overs domestic competition, Jaiswal racked up scores of 113, 22, 122, 203 and 60 not out, his run only coming to an end when rain knocked Mumbai out of the competition. The following year, he was India's batting mainstay in the Under-19 World Cup in South Africa, where he was the Player of the Tournament and the team finished runners-up. That paved the way for a big payday at the IPL, where he was signed for Rs 2.4 crore (about US$ 338,000) by Rajasthan Royals.The step up from tearing apart domestic bowlers and lording it over U-19 attacks wasn't quite smooth, but hard work and long hours spent working on his technique and skills at the Royals academy when training opened up after Covid helped his confidence, Jaiswal said. In his first full Ranji Trophy season, 2021-22, he made three successive hundreds in Mumbai's run to the final. At Royals, where he was retained ahead of the 2022 season, Jaiswal has formed a fearsome opening combination with Jos Buttler.  In the 2023 IPL, he set a new record for the fastest fifty in the tournament's history, off just 13 balls."
Tom Kohler-Cadmore,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/325900/325917.png",Rajasthan Royals,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Tom Kohler-Cadmore had made a name for himself as a Wisden Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year and one of the most-talented young batsmen in the county game - but it was a court case involving a former team-mate that brought him unwanted attention from a wider audience. Revelations during the trial of Alex Hepburn about sexist messages exchanged on a WhatsApp group led to Kohler-Cadmore and Joe Clarke being stood down from Lions duty and threatened to overshadow the start of a promising career.Kohler-Cadmore and Clarke, who both played alongside Hepburn at Worcestershire, were fined and banned for bringing the game into disrepute. But Kohler-Cadmore bounced back quickly, scoring 1729 runs across all formats in the 2019 county season - more than any of his Yorkshire team-mates - and winning a reprieve with the Lions for the winter tour of Australia. In May, with the English summer on hold due to Covid-19, he was named in England's 55-man return-to-training group as part of ECB plans to salvage as much of the international calendar as possible.His abilities as a destructive hitter, particularly down the ground, were not in doubt. In 2016, he struck the fastest hundred of the season, off 43 balls, and the following year he was tempted back to his home county, Yorkshire - a move that so infuriated Worcestershire's director of cricket, Steve Rhodes, that he was packed off in mid-season with barely time for his father - Mick, the New Road dressing room attendant - to say goodbye. In 2018, he was called up for a Lions debut, before news of court proceedings involving Hepburn put a check on his progress.An outstanding schoolboy player, Kohler-Cadmore won a cricket scholarship to Malvern College and amassed 1,409 runs at an average in excess of 100 in his final year to claim the 2014 Wisden award. Brought up through Yorkshire's age-group teams - his name is inherited from his mother's German origins - he opted to sign for Worcestershire, where he made his debut as a teenager. Despite failing to reach 20 in his first eight first-class innings, he gradually found his feet. A century in a non-first-class game against Cambridge MCCU was followed by successive half-centuries against Leicestershire and Glamorgan before an innings of 99 against Leicestershire in July 2014. The maiden first-class century finally came in the final game of the 2015 season, against Middlesex at New Road, and two more followed in 2016, including a career-best 169 against Gloucestershire.  Proof of his dangerous T20 talents came when he posted 127 off 54 - then Worcestershire's highest individual score in that format - against Durham at New Road.His career at Worcestershire ended abruptly in May 2017 after he told the club he would not be signing a new contract. Having declined large offers from several clubs - Warwickshire among them - he decided to return to Yorkshire, having just struck a century against them in a Royal London Cup tie at New Road. Rhodes, proud of a young side awash with homegrown talent, reacted furiously and, having informed Kohler-Cadmore he wouldn't be picked again, his move to Yorkshire was brought forward. He made his first team debut for them in July.Five years later, he was on the move again, released from the final year of his Yorkshire contract in order to sign for Somerset. The club had sacked its staff en masse in the fall-out from Azeem Rafiq's allegations of institutional racism - his father, Mick, stepped down from his role as dressing-room attendant in solidarity with those let go - and when Kohler-Cadmore returned from the PSL with concussion symptoms, he was frustrated that his return was effectively delayed by the lack of medical staff in place. Amid the general sense of turbulence at the club, he decided it was time to move on.While his first-class returns dipped, Kohler-Cadmore became a regular on the franchise circuit, spending his winter plundering runs in the Middle East and on the subcontinent. He won back-to-back Abu Dhabi T10 titles, and his reinvention as a keeper-batter ensured that he continued to pick up gigs around the world.ESPNcricinfo staff"
Sanju Samson,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/322700/322701.png",Rajasthan Royals,Right hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Sanju Samson IPL factfile- Sanju Samson is the captain of Rajasthan Royals (RR) and also their highest run-scorer with 3403 runs before the start of the 2024 Indian Premier League (IPL)- He played for Royals from 2013 to 2015 and then from 2018 onwards. Samson was part of the Delhi squad in 2016 and 2017, when Royals were banned for two IPL seasons because of corruption charges. His first stint in the IPL was in 2012, when he was part of the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) squad but did not play a game for them.- At the age of 19, Samson won the best young player of the season award in 2013, for scoring 206 runs and taking 13 catches. He has scored three IPL centuries to date.- An attacking top-order batter and wicketkeeper, Samson led Royals to the IPL final in 2022, where they came runners-up to Gujarat TitansSanju Samson player profileSanju Samson was perhaps the first top-drawer Indian player to be known primarily for his feats for his IPL franchise than for the national side. A Rajasthan Royals mainstay, he has made over 3000 runs for them in the course of his first eight seasons.Samson moved to Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala in his early teens after taking his first cricket lessons in Delhi, where his father worked as a police constable. In Kerala, he created waves on the junior circuit with his batting, showing impressive technique and an ability to time the ball crisply. He made it to the India side for the Under-19 Asia Cup in 2011 but did not impress in the tournament, and missed out on selection for India's U-19 World Cup side the following year. Rajasthan Royals bought Samson at the IPL auction in 2013, when he was 18, and save for the two years when the side was out of the league for a ban, he has been a fixture in their line-up. He was appointed captain in 2021, when he made 484 runs, kicking off with a barnstorming 119 off 63 balls in their tournament opener, against Punjab Kings, followed by three 40s in a row later in the season, and then an unbeaten 70 and 82 in back-to-back games. His fine, consistent displays did not reflect in Royals' finishes on the tournament's points table, which continued to be disappointing up until 2022, when they were second (Samson made 458 runs that year).He made his first-class debut in 2011-12, and impressed with bat and as keeper for Kerala in the Ranji Trophy. In 2013-14 he finished with 530 runs at an average of just under 60, including a double-hundred in his first game; that was followed by 475 runs the next season. In 2015-16, he was 20 when he was appointed captain of the Kerala side. In October 2019, in a showcase of his by then formidable white-ball skills, Samson made 212 not out, the highest score in the history of the Vijay Hazare Trophy at the time, for Kerala against Goa.A call-up to the India T20 side came in July 2015, and he made his debut against Zimbabwe in Harare, but then went four and a half years before his next game in the format for India. He made his ODI debut in 2021, which was followed a gap again, of a year before he played his next ODI - in a series in the West Indies, where he made 54 in the second match."

Ahead of IPL 2022, Royals bought Parag back for INR 3.8 crore, but he managed just 183 runs in 14 innings at an average of 16.64 and strike rate of 138.64. But having been identified as a future star, Parag continued to receive the franchise's backing. - In the 2023-24 Indian domestic season, he seemed to turn a corner. He hit 510 runs at a strike rate of 182.79 in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20s for Assam. This included seven back-to-back half-centuries. He was also the highest six-hitter at the 50-over Deodhar Trophy, the inter-zonal tournament. And the form extended into IPL 2024, where in the first half of the tournament he was constantly in contention for the Orange Cap. Riyan Parag player profileParag, a batting allrounder from Assam, impressed as an Under-19 player during India's 2017 tour of England, playing alongside Shubman Gill and Prithvi Shaw, among others - he scored three fifties in four innings in the four-dayers. That Indian team went on to win the 2018 Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand, but Parag only scored 17 runs in the two innings he got to play while also picking up three wickets.Before IPL 2019, Parag was bought by Rajasthan Royals for his base price of INR 20 lakh and has been with them since. That season, he became the youngest (at the time) to hit an IPL fifty. A lean phase followed, but he reinvented his batting and came out more confident in 2023, winning the Player-of-the-Series award in the 2023 Deodhar Trophy List A tournament - he was the highest run-getter, the highest six-hitter, and had the third-highest number of wickets. In the 2023-24 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy T20s, he was again the highest run-getter and highest six-hitter. The same season, Parag hit the second-fastest Ranji Trophy century ever, getting there in 56 balls against Chhatisgarh."

But he did not get to play that season.- Jurel made his IPL debut in 2023, and impressed everyone with his power-hitting in the death overs.- That season, he scored 152 runs from 11 innings, at an average of 21.71 and a strike rate of 172.72. Among those who scored at least 100 runs, his strike rate was the seventh highest"
Ravichandran Ashwin,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316500/316521.png",Rajasthan Royals,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Bowling Allrounder,"R Ashwin IPL factfile- Offspinner R Ashwin has played for five IPL teams since his debut season in 2009, and his most recent franchise is Rajasthan Royals (RR), whom he has been playing for since 2022.- With 171 wickets before the start of IPL 2024, Ashwin is among the top-five wicket-takers in IPL history.- Ashwin began his IPL career at Chennai Super Kings (CSK), whom he represented from 2008 to 2015. In the 2011 IPL final between CSK and RCB, MS Dhoni gave Ashwin the new ball and he took the key wicket of Chris Gayle in the first over. Ashwin's 20 wickets in 2011 is his highest tally in an IPL season to date.- After CSK were banned for two years following corruption charges, Ashwin played IPL 2016 for Rising Pune Supergiant and missed 2017 because of injury, before moving to Kings XI Punjab (KXIP, now Punjab Kings).- Ashwin was captain of KXIP from 2018, and in 2019 his mankading (run-out of the non-striker backing-up) of RR batter Jos Buttler became a subject of heated debate.- Ahead of IPL 2020, Ashwin was traded to Delhi Capitals, where he spent two seasons before moving to RR in 2022. At Royals, he was used up the order as a pinch-hitter and became the first batter to retire out tactically in an IPL game.R Ashwin player profileR Ashwin took the tricks and skills he learned playing tennis-ball cricket on the streets of Chennai, particularly the soduku ball, a finger-flicked legbreak, to Test cricket, where he became perhaps the leading offspinner of the first quarter of the 21st century.All through his career Ashwin has been a cricket nerd with a deep appreciation of the nuances of the game and an acute knowledge of his craft. And it was that sharp brain, along with the carrom ball, an equally good arm ball, and masterly control over his offbreaks that made him a quintessential limited-overs spinner early in his career. It was in Test cricket, though, that he became a force after he brought the full scope of his talents to bear on it. His success was desperately needed by India in the time after Anil Kumble retired and Harbhajan Singh was on the wane. Ashwin took nine wickets in his maiden Test, in which he was Player of the Match. In his first 16 Tests he collected nine five-fors, and he went on to be the fastest to 300 wickets and the second fastest to 400, behind only Muthiah Muralidaran.Among the highlights of Ashwin's Test career: 30 five-fors and counting, 90-odd wickets apiece against both Australia and England, and over 50 wickets a year four times. He reached his zenith in the 2016-17 home season, when he took 27 wickets in a three-Test series against New Zealand, 28 in five matches against England, six in a game against Bangladesh, and 21 against Australia in four Tests.Ashwin was picked by Chennai Super Kings in the IPL in 2009, and was one of the rare players who came into the public's reckoning through the IPL and proved himself good enough to have great success in Test cricket. He spent six seasons at CSK, winning the title twice, bowling at the top and the death, and coming on when wickets were required. He was the Man of the Series in the 2010 Champions League in South Africa.He was part of the winning squad in the 2011 World Cup, but got few chances in that tournament ahead of Harbhajan. In the 2015 tournament, he made up with 13 wickets from eight games in India's run to the semi-final. In T20Is his finest hour was the World Cup in 2014, when he took 4 for 11 against Australia, and 11 wickets in all in the tournament, where India lost in the final.An opener with the bat before he took up offspin, Ashwin has been a more than handy lower-order batter, correct, possessed of shots, and with five Test hundreds to his name."

He started out leading West Indies to their first Under-19 World Cup title, in 2015-16, and then made his name as a lower-middle-order bruiser in T20 cricket. In the early 2020s in the IPL, his ability to go from zero to 60 in no time paid dividends for Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals. In the same vein, Hetmyer made a hundred at two runs a ball in 2018 against Jamaica Tallawahs for Guyana Amazon Warriors in the CPL. That same season, in ODI cricket, where he largely slots in as a hard-hitting No. 5 for West Indies, he made two hundreds in three games, against Bangladesh at home and India away."

Powell's maiden ODI hundred, against Ireland in 2018, helped West Indies to a crucial win in the World Cup qualifier, and he captained a weakened side in Bangladesh later that year, but was left out of the squad for the World Cup itself, in 2019.He has been a consistent performer for Jamaica in white-ball cricket, with runs from the middle order, and captained the Tallawahs franchise in the 2020 CPL. He was Player of the Match in the final of the inaugural Abu Dhabi T10 League in 2018, hitting 61 not out off 25 balls for the victorious Northern Warriors.In 2022, at the start of a year in which he got an extended run in the West Indies T20I side, he made 107 off 53 balls against England at home and a few games later, 68 and 61 against India and Bangladesh away, both unbeaten. He also played every game in his first IPL season for Delhi Capitals, teeing off sharply from the lower middle-order to produce an impressive run of scores."
Trent Boult,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383100/383185.png",Rajasthan Royals,Right hand Bat,Left arm Fast medium,Bowler,"Rated as one half of the best new-ball pair in New Zealand history by Sir Richard Hadlee, Trent Boult is a left-arm quick who presents a significant threat to batsmen around the world with an ability to move the ball both ways even in unresponsive conditions.Born in the Bay of Plenty region in New Zealand's North Island, Boult is, in the words of his brother Jono, a ""normal sort of Kiwi young guyâ€¦ into his golf and fishing and surfing."" Cricket, though, was his calling. He lived in a neighbourhood which included eventual New Zealand team-mates Kane Williamson and Doug Bracewell, and had the backing of a supportive household that also kept him grounded. Signs of his skill were evident even as a teenager. As a 17-year-old, he was named the fastest secondary school bowler in the country. A year later, he was representing New Zealand at the Under-19 World Cup.The transition to senior cricket, though, was not quite seamless. Boult suffered a stress fracture of the back in 2009 which put him out of cricket for two years and taught him to concentrate on strength and conditioning. There was speculation that the injury was a consequence of tinkering with his bowling action. So, under the supervision of one of his idols, Shane Bond, Boult reverted to the action he had used as a boy and the results were more than promising. By 2015, he was capable of long spells without wavering too far below the 140kph mark. He became one of New Zealand's irreplaceable players across formats and one of many protagonists in the side's march to their first World Cup final in 2015. Boult had a tough time breaking into the limited-overs sides at first, due to a perception that he doesn't move the white ball as much as the red one. But his effectiveness in Test cricket was too compelling to ignore: he raced past 100 wickets in his 29th match and in 2013, only two years since his debut, he was New Zealand's top-wicket taker. With Brendon McCullum placing a high premium on attacking cricket in the shorter versions as well and Boult proving himself as a bowler who preferred getting batsmen out rather than keeping them quiet, it was a perfect fit. Confirmation came in World Cup 2015 when he ended up the joint-leading wicket taker with 22 scalps in nine matches including 5 for 27 in an epic victory over Australia. His worth in T20 cricket was emphasised by a (approximately) $600,000 payday in the IPL.Boult's strength, according to Northern Districts coach John Pamment, is that, ""he's got a lovely wrist position and the fact that the wrist goes right behind the ball gives him that control."" Another asset for Boult is friend and sounding board Tim Southee. When on song, their partnership makes for compelling viewing, not to mention telling numbers. In 2014, the pair picked up nearly half the wickets New Zealand took - 67 of 143 - en route to the side's most successful Test year, with five wins in nine matches. The pair have both raced past 200 Test wickets and by 2019 occupy third and fourth on New Zealand's all-time Test wicket-taking list behind Hadlee and Daniel Vettori. Boult was again magnificent in the 2019 World Cup helping lead New Zealand's attack taking 17 wickets. He took a hat-trick against Australia, and the key wicket of Virat Kohli in the semi-final win over India.

Sandeep, who began as a batsman for his school in Patiala before his coach persuaded him to take up bowling seriously, was part of India's Under-19 squad for the 2010 World Cup in New Zealand. He came into his own in the same event two years later, in Australia, where he took four wickets in the final, against the hosts, and finished as the joint-highest wicket-taker for India (12). As a result, Sandeep was signed by Kings XI Punjab ahead of the 2013 season. In three seasons for his franchise, Sandeep not only took 39 wickets, but was regularly employed by his captain George Bailey to bowl the death overs. Sandeep was soon drafted into India's T20 side for the two-match series against Zimbabwe in 2015, where he failed to deliver. In 2014, however, Sandeep suffered a stress fracture of the back that kept him out of competitive cricket for five months. He returned strongly to claim 28 scalps in the 2014-15 Ranji Trophy, the most for his side.  ESPNcricinfo Staff"

A former chess player who represented India at junior levels, Chahal made his first-class debut for Haryana the same year and was signed by Mumbai Indians in 2011 to be part of their IPL squad. He didn't play a game that season but was still named in Mumbai's Champions League T20 squad the same year. It was in the Champions League that he got an extended run in the side - he featured in the playing XI in all the matches and starred in Mumbai's win in the final with a spell of 3-0-9-2. However, in the next two years with Mumbai, he managed only one game. His IPL fortunes mirrored those in domestic cricket, where he played in only eight matches in three seasons from 2011-12 onwards and picked up just 16 wickets.It was with Royal Challengers Bangalore, though, that he found the bulk of his success. He was their highest wicket-taker for two years running since the 2015 season and by virtue of that earned his first India caps in ODIs and T20Is on a tour of Zimbabwe in June 2016. While that series may have been seen as an opportunity to blood new players into international cricket, Chahal was called up again into the Indian T20 line-up to face England in January 2017, and delivered in style in the deciding game: his 6 for 25 in that match in Bangalore was part of an England collaspse of 8 for 8, and the third-best figures till then in T20Is.ESPNcricinfo staffYuzvendra Chahal IPL factfile- Signed by Mumbai Indians in 2011, Yuzvendra Chahal featured in just one IPL match across his first three seasons (apart from Champions League T20 games) before he was signed by Royal Challengers Bengaluru (then Royal Challengers Bangalore) ahead of IPL 2014 at his base price of INR 10 lakh.- Over the course of 113 matches across eight seasons, Chahal went on to become RCB's highest wicket-taker, but the franchise chose not to retain him ahead of the 2022 mega auction.- In 2015, he earned an India cap on the back of a prolific second season for RCB, where he was their highest wicket-taker with 23 scalps. - He followed that up with an equally prolific IPL 2016, where he was the tournament's second-highest wicket-taker (23) behind Bhuvneshwar Kumar. It coincided with RCB's inspired run to the finals.- At the 2022 mega auction, Chahal was signed by Rajasthan Royals for INR 6.5 crore, and he made an immediate impression by winning the Purple Cap for most wickets (27) as Royals made their first IPL final since 2008; they finished runners-up to Gujarat Titans. That season, he also picked up a hat-trick against Kolkata Knight Riders at Brabourne Stadium.- During IPL 2023, Chahal went past Dwayne Bravo to become IPL's leading wicket-taker. His record-breaking feat came at Eden Gardens, the scene of his IPL debut."
Virat Kohli,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316605.png",Royal Challengers Bengaluru,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Top order Batter,"Virat Kohli player profileIndia has given to the world many a great cricketer but perhaps none as ambitious as Virat Kohli. To meet his ambition, Kohli employed the technical assiduousness of Sachin Tendulkar and fitness that was in the league of top athletes in the world, not just cricketers. As a result, Kohli became the most consistent all-format accumulator of his time, making jaw-dropping chases look easy, and finding, in his own words, the safest possible way to score runs. Plenty of them.This ambition transferred seamlessly to his captaincy: he demanded more than ever of his bowlers especially the quick ones, often sacrificed a batsman for bowling depth, and led India to a long stay at No. 1 in Test rankings and a first-ever series win in Australia. He is well on his way to end up as India's most successful Test captain.  Barring one in Bangladesh, Kohli scored Test hundreds in and against every country he played. He absolutely smashed records for number of matches taken to reach eight, nine, ten and eleven thousand ODI runs, and became the first batter to score 50 hundreds in one-day internationals.An Under-19 world Cup-winning captain, when he burst onto the scene, Kohli was a precocious talent with a cover drive to kill for. He was destined to be India's next big batsman as the Tendulkar era began to retire, but Kohli wanted to be more: a cricketer whom the opposition would be in awe of, a cricketer whose presence would raise the intensity of the contest. He lived every ball, competed each moment, and made sure he had the fitness and strength to do so. He was widely credited for changing the fitness culture in Indian cricket, introducing endurance tests as a criterion for selection. Kohli was quite simply India's most powerful captain. Centre of every marketing campaign for Indian cricket, he also happened to lead at a time when the BCCI was run by interim administrators who knew better than to draw the ire of Indian cricket's biggest star. There was never any cause to doubt his intent: to do things that will win matches for India, which they did plenty under him.Virat Kohli IPL factfile - Virat Kohli is the only player in the Indian Premier League (IPL) to have played all seasons for one team: Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) - He was picked by RCB soon after he captained India to victory in the 2008 Under-19 World Cup and has been retained by them ever since - Kohli is the IPL's highest run-scorer and the only one with more than 8000 runs - He holds the record for most IPL centuries (8) as well as most runs in a season (973 runs in 2016). He has won the Orange Cap twice - in 2016 and 2024 - Kohli captained RCB full-time from 2013 to 2021 and led them to the final in the 2016 season, when they lost to Sunrisers Hyderabad - Kohli holds the record for the most prolific partnerships in the IPL, with AB de Villiers (3123 runs) and Chris Gayle (2787 runs) - His popularity has made RCB one of the most followed teams in the IPL, even though they haven't yet won a title"
Faf du Plessis,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316500/316559.png",Royal Challengers Bengaluru,Right hand Bat,Legbreak,Middle order Batter,"Faf du Plessis player profileClassy, composed and a fine crafter of innings', Faf du Plessis emerged as one of South Africa's most consistent batsmen in the post-Jacques Kallis era. Du Plessis is strong on the front foot, has impeccable defences and enjoys spending time at the crease. A natural leader, du Plessis was put in charge of the T20 side in February 2013 and formed part of the senior core in other formats. All that may have been lost when, in 2007, du Plessis signed a Kolpak deal with Lancashire. Unlike his high-school contemporary, AB de Villiers, du Plessis did not manage to fast-track himself into the international spotlight and looked abroad for other opportunities. Apart from learning the rigours of the county system, du Plessis made a name for his fielding.He returned to South Africa to play domestic cricket every summer and topped the MTN40 run charts in the 2010-11 season. His Kolpak deal had expired by then and he was selected in South Africa's one-day squad for the home series against India in January 2011. A half-century on debut sealed his spot for the World Cup that followed. At that point, du Plessis was known as an aggressive ball-striker and quick run-scorer.He was part of the South Africa Test squad that took the Test mace off England in mid-2012, but did not play a game, instead getting a T20 debut on that tour. He got his Test chance on South Africa's tour to Australia later that year and followed his first-innings 78 in the second Test in Adelaide with a stonewalling effort for the ages in the second innings. Du Plessis spent more than seven-and-a-half hours at the crease, faced 376 balls and remained unbeaten on 110 to take South Africa to an unlikely draw, which set them up for a series win in Perth.His curve continued upwards when in December that year, du Plessis was given the T20 captaincy in a series against New Zealand, despite only having played four T20Is prior to that. He was then given the role permanently the following February. Du Plessis had established himself as a complete batsmen, who had the ability to shift gears and anchor an innings, and played a similar knock against India in December 2013. His 134 in the second innings of the Johannesburg Test took South Africa within eight runs of completing the highest successful Test chase, 458, and in the end secured a draw. When Kallis retired after the next match, du Plessis was an automatic choice for promotion to No.3. It took du Plessis a little longer to repeat those feats in limited-overs. In his 51st ODI, he finally scored his first century in the format, against Australia in a triangular series in Harare in August 2014, but then the floodgates opened. Two more hundreds came in that series, which South Africa won. Du Plessis took good form into the 2015 World Cup, after becoming the second South African to score a T20I century after Richard Levi, in February that year. He was among those left devastated by South Africa's semi-final loss. While du Plessis continued to rack up runs in ODIs, he was criticised for occasionally scoring too slowly. He started to struggle in the longest format and after managing just one fifty in 12 innings in the 2015-16 season, he was dropped for the final Test against England in January 2016. Du Plessis led South Africa in two World T20 campaigns, in 2014 and 2016, and despite them returning empty-handed from both, he confirmed his desire to keep the captaincy. Faf du Plessis IPL factfile- Faf du Plessis has won two IPL finals, both with Chennai Super Kings (CSK), in 2018 and 2021.- Du Plessis was the Player of the Match in the 2021 final for his 59-ball 86, which took CSK to 192 against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR).- Du Plessis has played for two other teams in the IPL: Rising Pune Supergiant (RPSG) and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), captaining RCB since 2022.- As of 2024, he is one of the only five players to have scored 4000 or more IPL runs without a century to their name. The others are MS Dhoni, Robin Uthappa, Dinesh Karthik and Gautam Gambhir."

Contracted to Western Australia as a schoolboy, he took 5 for 24 on first-class debut against Tasmania in February 2017 as a 17-year-old. He was selected initially for his bowling given his 200cm frame and his ability to deliver fast outswing but was plagued by stress fractures. However, throughout his junior days with Subiaco-Floreat and WA's junior teams his technically sound batting and an unquenchable thirst for scoring runs saw him emerge as a genuine allrounder of rare ability. Green didn't play any first-class cricket in 2017-18 and spent the 2018 winter at Cricket Australia's National Performance Centre in Brisbane. His game went to another level in 2019-20 after another stress fracture in his lower back forced him to stop bowling again. He made his maiden first-class century, producing scores of 87* and 121* to force an extraordinary draw against Queensland at the Gabba. He would score two more centuries that summer before posting a career-best 197 from 438 balls against New South Wales in October 2020. That performance led to his first international call-up as he was named in Australia's ODI and T20I squads to face a touring India side which was followed by a Test debut against the same opposition. He made half-centuries in each of his first four series then claimed a maiden five-wicket haul against South Africa the MCG in late 2022 - during a game where he badly broke his finger. Shortly after returning to side in India he made a maiden Test hundred in Ahmedabad.By then, his cross-format skills had caught the eye after a pair of dazzling T20I fifties in India led to a bidding war in the 2022 IPL auction where Green fetched AU$3.15million from Mumbai Indians and he went on to flay a memorable 47-ball century in the 2023 tournament.However, the demand of being a three-format player brought challenges and Test cricket was a struggle during the 2023 Ashes with Green eventually losing his spot to the resurgent Mitchell Marsh. But such was the desire of the selectors to get him back into the side that when David Warner retired the move to promote Steven Smith to open was largely to accommodate Green at No. 4. Three matches into the role, he struck a magnificent 174 not out in Wellington.

He played only four games that season and was subsequently released. - In 2022, he joined them as a replacement player and finished the season as their third-highest run-scorer, with a tally of 333 at a strike rate of 152.75. - He missed the IPL 2023 because of a heel injury."

His ability to make unconventional shots - reverse sweeps and pulls, for example - appear routine makes it hard to set fields to cover all of his scoring areas. Maxwell's audacity comes with risk, and he can exasperate as well as exhilarate, but at his best he can change a game in moments. Also a handy offspinner and outstanding fielder, Maxwell offers an impressive package in one-day and T20 cricket when things click. To date, his most extraordinary display (among many) came against Afghanistan in the 2023 ODI World Cup when he struck a monumental 201 not out off 128 balls lead Australia to a remarkable victory from an almost hopeless positionIn 2017 he made his first Test hundred, against India in Ranchi. He was subsequently briefly dropped from the ODI side but came back and made his third T20I century in Bangalore early in 2019 to help Australia chase 191. The ODI series against Pakistan in the UAE that followed was a high point as well.Late in 2019, Maxwell took a mental-health break from the game. The time away, along with conversations about his role with white-ball captain Aaron Finch, helped revive his form - he made five scores of over 45 in six ODI innings in 2020, had an impressive IPL season with Royal Challengers Bangalore the following year, and in January 2022, became the first batter to breach the 150-run mark in a BBL innings. However, he made little impact in the 2021 and 2022 T20 World Cups.He made his name for Victoria with a 19-ball half-century against Tasmania in 2010-11, the fastest fifty in Australia's one-day domestic history, and transferred that talent to the international stage. At the 2015 World Cup he blasted a 51-ball hundred against Sri Lanka in Sydney, then the fastest for Australia in ODIs, and the second-quickest in World Cup history. Australia have also used Maxwell in Tests but to less effect. However, in Delhi in 2013 he had the distinction of opening the batting and bowling in the same Test, as Australia strove in vain to turn their disastrous series around. He came close to a recall on the 2022 tour of Sri Lanka.In late 2022 he suffered a badly broken leg when he slipped at a friend's birthday party."

Lomror is an aggressive batsman who fearlessly goes for the big shots, much like how his role model Adam Gilchrist used to. Lomror was picked as an allrounder for the Under-19 World Cup in 2016 and impressed in only his second match, against New Zealand, with a quick 45 in the lower order and a five-for to follow.He rose to the top level after representing Rajasthan in the Under-16 and Under-19 levels across formats. When he was picked for the India Under-19s in the run-up to the World Cup, he impressed in a tri-series in Sri Lanka, by claiming 4 for 10 in five overs against England. Less than two months later, Delhi Daredevils bought him for INR 10 lakh ($US 14,800) in the 2016 IPL auction."
Dinesh Karthik,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/319900/319934.png",Royal Challengers Bengaluru,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Not many would forget the sight of Dinesh Karthik in India colours, horizontal on the ground, as he stumped Michael Vaughan in 2004. It was his first dismissal as a wicketkeeper for India, but his international career never really took off. Around the time he began churning out consistent runs in domestic cricket, India had MS Dhoni at the helm and behind the stumps, so there was very little Karthik could do. A man who was an integral part of a Test series victory over England in 2007, who showed he could open the batting in spicy conditions, just could not capitalise on his second chances. Karthik was still a giant in domestic cricket though, and had a knack for turning up on turning tracks. No doubt his penchant to sweep, reverse sweep and hare down that track at spinners helped his cause. Those quick feet have at times failed him behind the stumps - often at crucial junctures. He was recalled to the Indian side for a tour of Bangladesh in 2014 - but his wicketkeeping let him down.Karthik made over 1000 first-class runs in the 2008-09 season, with five centuries including a 213 as Tamil Nadu captain as they reached the semi-finals. For five seasons since - barring 2010-11, 2013 [when he played only one match] and 2015-16 - he had maintained a batting average above 40. Karthik found himself in contention again after Dhoni's retirement in 2014, but Wriddhiman Saha was preferred because he was seen as the stronger keeper.An in-and-out history with the Indian team didn't help. He was picked in the one-day squad, as replacement for Parthiv Patel in August 2004, and made his debut in a NatWest Challenge game against England where he pulled off a superb stumping. Shortly afterwards, he was called up to make his Test debut against Australia but when he could manage only one fifty in ten matches, he was axed.He made a comeback in 2008 - picked in the Indian side for all three formats for a tour of New Zealand - but his middling performances continued over the following year and did not allow him to cement a place in the team. He fell out of contention, until a fine 2012-13 domestic season got him back into the ODI side for the 2013 Champions Trophy in England but it proved to be another false dawn.Karthik may feel unfulfilled when he looks back on his international career, but the IPL should have helped soothe him. He was bought at INR 12.5 crore by Delhi Daredevils in the 2014 auction and the next year, he netted INR 10.5 crore courtesy Royal Challengers Bangalore. He was acquired by Gujarat Lions for INR 2.3 crore in 2016.ESPNcricinfo staff"

The left-arm-spin-bowling allrounder was part of India's 25 probables for the 2008 Under-19 World Cup, but ultimately did not make the squad for Malaysia.

Over the next ten years, he played just 76 domestic matches, of which 31 came during the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons. Swapnil claimed 6 for 19, the second-best bowling figures in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament, and was later bought for INR 10 lakhs by the erstwhile Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings) at the 2016 IPL auction. Under Glenn Maxwell's captaincy at PBKS, he made his IPL debut, with a maiden wicket of MS Dhoni. Later, he was with Lucknow Super Giants during IPL 2023, while in IPL 2024, Swapnil played six league games with his new team Royal Challengers Bengaluru. His tidy bowling helped RCB win their last six matches to qualify for the playoffs. Domestically, Swapnil has moved from Baroda to Uttarakhand.

It was the highest amount earned by a domestic uncapped player in the auction, and was reward for a solid season with Sunrisers in 2013, when he grabbed 11 wickets in 13 matches at an economy rate of 6.60. He formed a potent combination with India legspinner Amit Mishra as Sunrisers beat expectations to reach the semi-finals in their first season.He has been around in the domestic circuit since 2007 representing Railways, but it was only during the 2012-13 season that he really made heads turn.

It included an eight-wicket innings haul against defending champions Rajasthan, which remains a highlight of his first-class career.He repeated his solid IPL showing in 2014, with 15 wickets at 25.06, before showing a glimpse of his batting skills against South Africa A when India A toured Australia - given limited opportunities there, he got India A across the line in a nail-biting chase with 39 off 16 at No. 9. Not long after, he was rewarded with an India call-up, making the limited-overs squad for the tour to England and debuting for the country in a T20 international. Later in the year, after consistently claiming wickets against touring teams for India A, he got a maiden Test call-up: for the tour to Australia.

In 2017, he bagged an IPL contract worth INR 2.6 crore. Months later, he was wearing an India shirt and bowling in a T20 international against New Zealand. Sturdy and athletic, Siraj has a deceptive run-up, which initially suggests that a left-arm bowler is steaming in. He is, however, a right-armer and by his own admission is a natural at getting the ball to swing into the right-hander. He has always been able to bowl a pretty quick bouncer though, something that had impressed his captain David Warner and team mentor VVS Laxman in the Sunrisers Hyderabad set-up. Potential translated to performance when he was his state's highest wicket-taker playing only his second season of Ranji Trophy - 41 wickets in nine matches. He was subsequently picked to play for the Rest of India and was brought on board by the India A team as well for a tour of South Africa in July-August 2017.

He first came to attention in the 2008 Under-19 World Cup, after which he was the leading run-scorer in the South African first-class competition in 2009-10, with 1189 runs at 66.05. But though he went on to average over 40 in first-class cricket in 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14, he was unable to break into to the Test team. Eventually, in August 2014, Rossouw was included in a South Africa ODI squad, but he had a nightmarish start in international cricket, racking up four ducks in his first six innings. The selectors, though, stuck with him and he was included in the T20 squad for the Australia tour in November 2014, where he scored 78 in his first match. Two months on, Rossouw made his first international century, against West Indies in Johannesburg, in the match where AB de Villiers broke the record for fastest ODI hundred, and he averaged 52 in the six games he played in the ODI World Cup that followed. In October 2016 he hit a sensational 122 to secure a 5-0 ODI series win over Australia, but he announced early the next year that he had signed for Hampshire as a Kolpak. He made an immediate impact in England, smashing a career-best 156 against Somerset in the Royal London Cup. Rossouw became a man in demand on the franchise T20 circuit at the tail end of the 2010s and into the next decade, finishing the 2018-19 Bangladesh Premier League as the leading run-scorer, with 558 runs. He won the Pakistan Super League with Quetta in 2019 and two years later with Multan Sultans; in 2022 he made 275 runs as Sultans made it to the final again and lost.Later that year, the UK having exited the European Union, Rossouw, no longer able to qualify to play county cricket other than as an overseas player, returned to South Africa colours. He did so with a bang, making an unbeaten 96 and two back-to-back T20I hundreds as their No. 3 in his first few innings back, against England, India and Bangladesh - the last of those in the World Cup, where South Africa eventually endured a shock exit at the hands of Netherlands."

His domestic performances for Himachal Pradesh, a bulk of which came in seamer-friendly conditions in Dharamsala, earned him an ODI debut during the limited-overs series in Australia in January 2016.He first hit the headlines as a 16-year-old in 2006, when he scored 340 for Himachal Pradesh in an Under-19 match against Railways in the Cooch Behar Trophy. Three years later, he was fast-tracked into the first-class setup, where his bowling performances overshadowed his batting. Dhawan finished the 2013-14 Ranji Trophy as the highest wicket-taker - 49 from eight matches - and earned an India A call-up for a limited-overs tour of Australia in July 2014. He showcased his batting potential in the final there by scoring an unbeaten 56 at No. 7 to help India A clinch the title. His continued good form in the Ranji Trophy season that followed, that fetched him 40 wickets, put him on the selection radar for the senior team.Dhawan's IPL career hasn't hit the high notes though. After two years on the fringes with Mumbai Indians, he was signed by Kings XI Punjab for INR 3 crores in 2014. His performances have been steady, if not spectacular, having been used mainly as a stop-gap bowling option. He was retained ahead of the 2016 auction.ESPNcricinfo staff"

After taking 23 wickets at an impressive average of 11 in the 2008-09 Under-19 Vinoo Mankad Trophy, Harshal made his List-A debut for Gujarat in 2008-09. Harshal also played for India in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand and soon bagged an IPL contract with Mumbai Indians.Unable to find a place in the Gujarat side, Harshal moved to Haryana and made an immediate impact in his debut Ranji Trophy season in 2011-12, running through Karnataka and Rajasthan with eight-fors in the quarter-final and semi-final. He finished that Ranji season with 28 wickets and made his IPL debut for Royal Challengers Bangalore against Delhi Daredevils in the 2012 edition. Harshal, however, was largely seen as a back-up seamer in the franchise set-up, instead of a first-choice option. He did not get a game in IPL 2013, but was bought back by the franchise in the 2014 player auction. While his first-class form dipped in between, he made a strong comeback in the 2015-16 season. His tally of 22 wickets in Ranji Trophy 2015-16 added to a haul of 13 wickets in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, in which he also picked up his maiden List A five-for. He was retained by Royal Challengers Bangalore ahead of the IPL 2016 player auction.After fighting through a period of self-doubts, Harshal roared back by picking up 52 wickets in nine matches at the 2019-20 Ranji Trophy, breaking left-arm spinner Rajinder Goel's 36-year-old record for the most wickets in a season for Haryana.But it was in the the 50-over Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy that season where his all-round prowess came to the fore. He picked up 19 wicketsÂ at an economy of 7.04, the joint second-most that season, just one behind stopper R Sai Kishore. He also contributed massively with the bat, makingÂ 374 runsÂ at an average of 31.16 and a strike rate of 165.48.Ahead of IPL 2021, he was traded to Royal Challengers Bangalore after a brief stint with Delhi Capitals. It turned out to be a breakthrough year, where he finished with 32 wickets, the joint-most in an IPL season with Dwayne Bravo. His mastery over the dipping yorker and several slower variations earned him plaudits. The performances were enough to impress the national selectors, and a T20I debut followed against the touring New Zealand side in November 2020. In February 2021, Harshal was bought for a mind-boggling INR 10.75 crore (USD 1.4 million) by Royal Challengers. It was 53.75 times his previous IPL salary.ESPNcricinfo staff"

The year after, fresh off two T20Is against England, when Mumbai had a middling season, he did just as well, taking 13 wickets and finishing as their second most prolific wicket-taker.Like many leggies who make an impact in T20, Chahar is not a big turner of the ball, but has good loop and drift, and makes subtle use of his variations in length and pace.Like his cousin Deepak, Chahar plays for Rajasthan in the Ranji Trophy, for whom he made his first-class and List A debuts in 2016-17. Two seasons on, though the team had a dismal outing in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, Chahar was third on the wicket-takers' list for the tournament, with 20."

A death-overs specialist known for his accurate yorkers and 140kph-plus deliveries, he made his international debut in England in 2022.That debut, though, was several years in the making. Arshdeep was part of the 2018 title-winning Under-19 World Cup squad, and his three wickets in two matches at an economy of 2 were the beginning of a golden year for him. He made his List A debut for Punjab, got picked up by Punjab Kings in the IPL auction, and took an eight-for in an U-23 match against Rajasthan.He had two quiet IPL seasons - he picked up three wickets in three games in 2019, and nine in eight in 2020 - but PBKS backed him. He repaid their faith by taking 18 in the 2021 season, when he was the side's second highest wicket-taker, and 17 in 2023, the most for the franchise that year. After his T20I debut in England, Arshdeep took seven wickets in in five games against West Indies, a performance that got him into the 2022 T20 Asia Cup, where he was the only bowler other than Bhuvneshwar Kumar to pick up more than four wickets. He did even better at the T20 World Cup later that year, where he was India's top wicket-taker. In his first game, in front of 90,000 spectators at the MCG, Arshdeep produced a spell for the ages, removing Babar Azam with an inswinger with his first ball and sending back Mohammad Rizwan with a searing bouncer to leave Pakistan at 15 for 2.In ODIs, he went wicketless in his first series, against New Zealand in 2022, but picked up his first international five-for against South Africa in 2023, starring in India's series win with ten wickets at a remarkable economy of 3.51.Arshdeep Singh IPL factfile- A member of the India team that won the Under-19 World Cup in 2018, Arshdeep Singh was bought by Punjab Kings (PBKS, then Kings XI Punjab) for his base price of INR 20 lakh ahead of IPL 2019.- After just three appearances in his debut season, Arshdeep played eight games and picked up nine wickets in IPL 2020 at an economy rate of 8.77.- IPL 2021 was his breakout season, as Arshdeep picked up 18 wickets from 12 games. His knack of nailing yorkers from his left-armer's angle made him a gun bowler at the death for Punjab. He also returned his career-best T20 figures of 5 for 32, against Rajasthan Royals, that season.- Arshdeep was retained by Punjab Kings for INR 4 crore ahead of the IPL 2022 auction, and ended the season with ten wickets at an economy rate of 7.70. His performances earned him a spot in the India squad in the 2022 T20 World Cup too.- He had another good season in 2023, taking 17 wickets, even though Arshdeep was more expensive than in earlier seasons, going at 9.69. He is a part of Punjab Kings in IPL 2024 too."

The previous season the franchise had taken a punt on Gaikwad as one for the future, slotting him in as an anchoring opener who could attack when needed. They gave him six games and he showed what he was capable of, with over 200 runs. Towards the pointy end of the 2021 tournament, Gaikwad made 70 in the qualifier against Delhi Capitals and put on a partnership of 61 with Faf du Plessis in the final, taking CSK to 192, which turned out to be plenty. Fresh off that success, he captained Maharashtra in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament and made 259 runs.Gaikwad's first-class, List A and T20 debuts came in 2016-17, and he shone in the middle format, with 444 runs, the third highest in the Vijay Hazare Trophy that year.

He impressed, making an assured 73 against England in his first innings and bowling with good control on a sluggish surface at his home ground, Hamilton. Mitchell, the son of former New Zealand rugby union player and coach John Mitchell, scored his first Test hundred at the start of 2021, in an innings win over Pakistan in Christchurch, and his first ODI century that March. In T20Is, when promoted to open at the 2021 T20 World Cup, he played a key role in New Zealand's run to the final, with an unbeaten 72 against England in the semi-final. Though New Zealand had a poor tour of England in 2022, losing all three Tests, Mitchell came out of the summer glowing, with two fifties and three hundreds, including a massive one at Trent Bridge. And he made a quick fifty against Pakistan in the T20 World Cup semi-final that year, though in a losing cause.Mitchell made his first-class debut at the end of the 2011-12 season and averaged 54.53 the following year. Though primarily a middle-order batter, his seam bowling became a useful asset over the years. He won a place in a New Zealand A squad to tour India and Sri Lanka, and while he found life tougher there, he responded with centuries in successive innings the following domestic season. An unbeaten 170 against Canterbury shortly before the England series in 2019 ensured he was in the frame for the debut that followed.Mitchell thrived in white-ball cricket in 2023. He made back-to-back ODI hundreds against Pakistan in Rawalpindi in April, and another against England in Cardiff ahead of the World Cup. In that tournament, in India, he shone with 552 runs at 69, just behind team-mate Rachin Ravindra on the run-scorers' table, helping New Zealand make their way to yet another ICC semi-final. Drafted into the IPL for Chennai Super Kings the following year, he was among the team's top three run-scorers in a middling season, outshining Ravindra, who opened."

He made his Test debut in 2013, after months of travelling with the squad, and then in his third match, he scored 51 not out and 96 in Durban. His first Test century followed soon, in a draw in Wellington in February 2014. Five months later, he was in the vanguard for India's first win at Lord's in nearly three decades, setting the game up with a solid 103 in the first innings. He followed it up with his maiden ODI century, at Edgbaston, as India wrapped up the ODI series 3-1.Rahane's impressive form continued, with hundreds in Melbourne and Colombo, and then two against South Africa in the 2015-16 Delhi Test, in a series where no one else scored a century. His partnership with Cheteshwar Pujara against Australia in the 2017 Bengaluru Test helped India level the series, which they went on to win two Tests later under Rahane's captaincy. Early in 2018, he produced a match-turning second-innings knock on a tough Johannesburg pitch, after having been dropped for the first two matches of the series, but he was no longer looking like the dominating Test batter he had previously been.Even so, his most significant Test innings was yet to come. When India were bowled out for 36 in Adelaide in December 2020, he took charge of an under-pressure team for the rest of the series (regular captain Virat Kohli left the tour for the birth of his child). In the next Test, in Melbourne, Rahane produced a masterclass hundred that set the tone for India's hard-fought series win. He was dropped again in 2022, but made a comeback in the 2023 World Test Championship final, where he top-scored for India, but they lost the title to Australia.Although known for his orthodox batting, Rahane has had success as a T20 batter as well. He scored over 500 runs in two IPL seasons for Rajasthan Royals, has two hundreds in the tournament, led Mumbai to the Syed Mushtaq Ali title in 2022-23, and astonished everyone with a belligerent 61 off 27 balls for Chennai Super Kings against Mumbai Indians in the 2023 IPL."

Six years before that, he had became the first Indian since Anil Kumble in 1993 to top the ICC ODI bowling rankings. In the IPL, he drew a scarcely believable bid of US$2 million in 2012. In an era in which he was bound to be overshadowed by the artistry of fellow spinner R Ashwin, Jadeja kept his senior colleague on his toes, and often stole the spot when conditions allowed India to play just the one spinner. It helped that he was a captain's dream: arguably the fastest man on the turf and the best fielder in the time that he played, he went on to become an important lower-order batter. Some of his best batting performances came against the top teams, and they were often accompanied by the swordsman's celebration that became his signature. Ten years into his career, he had five Test fifties and a hundred against England - the latter in a partnership of 222 with Rishabh Pant at Edgbaston in 2022 - and four half-centuries against Australia. It was all a far cry from the memes his batting inspired at the start of his career - though the ridicule directed at his three triple-hundreds in domestic cricket back then was more an indictment of the quality of bowling on the Indian first-class circuit at the time. Jadeja shone in India's 2013 Champions Trophy win, finishing as the leading wicket-taker, with 12 wickets, two of those in the final, where he also made an unbeaten 33.His most valuable assets as a bowler are perhaps his fitness and strength, which enable him to go at batters for hours, ready to pounce on any assistance from the pitch. Like with his batting, his bowling highlights too feature the best sides disproportionately. His first Test five-for came against Australia in Delhi in 2013, and was followed by 6 for 138 in his next match, against South Africa in Durban, though that was in an India defeat. When South Africa next visited India, he got stuck into them, with 23 wickets in the four Tests in 2015. Against England at home in 2016-17, he harvested 26; this included an impressive demolition job in Chennai, where he took 7 for 48 after India had racked up 759 runs. Later that season he took 25 wickets when Australia visited for four Tests, to go with the 24 from the previous time, in 2013. Through the first half of his career and beyond, Jadeja's place in the Test side was never quite secure. He had to fight through a serious shoulder injury, and he was even dropped from the squad, but he kept coming back. Of course, these hardships paled in comparison with a tough childhood in Jamnagar, and the hard knocks that marked his early career, including being banned by the IPL for a year for essentially trying to negotiate his salary. In that tournament, Jadeja has been synonymous with Chennai Super Kings, for whom he has taken over 100 wickets over nine seasons and whom he briefly captained in 2022.Ravindra Jadeja IPL factfile- Ravindra Jadeja has won the IPL final four times, once with Rajasthan Royals (RR) and three times with Chennai Super Kings (CSK).- He was the Player of the Match in CSK's thrilling win in 2023 when he hit a four off the last ball of the match.- The late Shane Warne marked him out as a future superstar when he captained the 19-year-old Jadeja in 2008, nicknaming him ""Rockstar"".- Jadeja is CSK's second-highest wicket-taker in the IPL, behind only Dwayne Bravo (140).- He was handed the CSK captaincy in 2022, but stepped down mid-season and MS Dhoni took the reins again. CSK finished joint-bottom of the table that year.- Jadeja holds the record for scoring most runs in an over in the IPL: he took 36 off RCB's Harshal Patel in a seven-ball over in 2021. The over went for 37 in all."

He was named in the one-day squad for the tour of England following the retirement of Daniel Vettori after the World Cup as New Zealand searched for another left-arm spin option. Santner was in to cover for the absence of the players at the IPL but made an immediate impression with a well-crafted 94 in a tour game against Somerset. He was handed his ODI debut at Edgbaston having played just 19 List A matches for Northern Districts. ""It's nice to have a left-arm spinner who turns,"" was a quip from the New Zealand camp.He made his Test debut later that year in the first ever day-night Test against Australia in Adelaide and made 31 and 45 batting at No.6 in both innings in a low-scoring game. He also took two wickets. Over the next four years his Test opportunities were limited but he became a mainstay in the white-ball teams for the Black Caps. His performances were so impressive that he was bought by the Chennai Super Kings in 2019 IPL to play under Stephen Fleming. He won a game by hitting a six off the last ball of the match against Rajasthan and took 2 for 13 from 4 overs in the IPL final against Mumbai, including the prized scalp of Rohit Sharma. His experience in that cauldron held him in good stead for the 2019 World Cup in England. He bowled a clutch spell in the semi-final win over India, strangling their middle order to help secure a spot in the final against England. Later in the same year he recorded a maiden Test century during an epic partnership with BJ Watling. The 261 they added was New Zealand's highest seventh-wicket stand in history and helped their side to 615-9, their highest Test total against England. The three wickets he claimed in England's second-innings also constituted new Test-best figures and helped New Zealand to a crushing innings victory.

MS Dhoni,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/319900/319946.png",Chennai Super Kings,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Wicketkeeper Batter,"MS Dhoni IPL factfile- MS Dhoni led India to three ICC titles but he is nearly as famous for his exploits in the yellow of Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League.- Dhoni, known as CSK's ""Thala"" (leader), captained the franchise to ten finals in their first 14 IPL seasons and won them five titles - in 2010, 2011, 2018, 2021 and 2023 . He's led them to the playoffs in 12 editions, making them the most consistent team in the IPL. In a surprise move on the eve of the IPL 2024 season opener, Dhoni stepped down as CSK captain and was succeeded by Ruturaj Gaikwad.- Dhoni was bought by CSK at the first IPL auction in 2008 and - barring a handful of games in 2022 - has been their captain ever since. No other player has led an IPL team for so long. Only when CSK was banned for two years on corruption charges - in 2016 and 2017 - did Dhoni play for another team in the IPL: Rising Pune Super Giant(s).- Dhoni's most memorable season with the bat was 2018, when he scored 455 runs at an average of 75.83 and strike rate of 150.66 to lead CSK to the title in their comeback season following the ban.- Dhoni was the first to play 250 matches in the IPL, reaching the milestone in 2023, four years after he played his last international game for India. He had resigned as CSK captain ahead of IPL 2022, but took back the captaincy after his successor Ravindra Jadeja stepped down mid-way through the season. He led the team to the title in 2023, before stepping down from captaincy again next year.MS Dhoni player profileMS Dhoni probably ranks as the third-most popular Indian cricketer ever, behind only Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli. He emerged from a cricketing backwater, the eastern Indian state of Jharkhand, and made it to the top with a home-made batting and wicketkeeping technique, and a style of captaincy that scaled the highs and hit the lows of both conservatism and unorthodoxy. Under Dhoni's leadership, India won the top prize in all formats: leading the Test rankings for 18 months starting December 2009, winning the 50-over World Cup in 2011, and the T20 world title on his captaincy debut in 2007.He seemingly emerged fully formed at 23, when he blasted two centuries in a triangular 50-over tournament for India A in Nairobi. Long-haired and fearless, he soon swaggered into international cricket, and became an instant darling of the crowds with ODI innings of 148 and 183 not out within a year of his debut.Dhoni improvised abd learned, but he didn't apologise for his batting style, which was not the most elegant. He became a multifaceted ODI batter, one who could accumulate, rebuild, and unleash big sixes, all seemingly at will.Along the way he showed leadership skills, which were recognised when Rahul Dravid gave up the captaincy in 2007. A day before that announcement from Dravid, a young India side under Dhoni played the first game of the first T20 World Cup in South Africa, and went on to win the tournament. The ODI captaincy was a natural progression, and the Test role duly followed too.Dhoni brought to the captaincy a thick skin and the relative indifference to results that an Indian captain needs to keep the job for long. Along with India's coach, Gary Kirsten, he put his senior performers in a comfortable place, and they repaid him by producing some of their best years in international cricket. Dhoni's sense of calm on the field mostly worked like a charm in the shorter formats, although he sometimes sat back for too long in Tests tactically. Still, India had some of their best years in Test cricket, in terms of tangible achievement, under him: in the 60 Tests he led in, they had a win-loss ratio of 1.5.However, after the 50-over World Cup win in 2011, which Dhoni sealed with a timely 91 and a six off his patented helicopter shot, an ageing team lost eight straight Tests on the trot away from home and his captaincy came under immense pressure, which was then exacerbated by India's first home series loss in eight years, 2-1 to England in 2012-13. This brought about a new chapter in Dhoni's career, where he seemed more assertive as a captain, building a new team. He played his best Test innings on a turner to win India the Chennai Test in 2013 against Australia, and became the first captain to lead India to four wins in a Test series. Away from home in the winter of 2013-14, India lost Test series in South Africa and New Zealand by 1-0 margins that did not reflect how close they came to winning both. The England tour of 2014 began promisingly, with a drawn first Test followed by a historic win at Lord's, but India crashed to earth immediately afterwards to lose the series 3-1. At Old Trafford and The Oval, with the batting crumbling around him, Dhoni played a couple of his bravest innings in Tests.On the tour of Australia that followed, India competed ferociously, thanks to a young batting core led by Kohli, but it didn't quite show in their results. Dhoni announced after the third Test, in Melbourne, that he was retiring from the format. He ended his career in whites with a proud record for a wicketkeeper: 4876 runs at an average of just over 38, six hundreds, and just under 300 dismissals. Dhoni continued to lead India in the shorter formats, and they got to the semi-finals of the 2015 World Cup. A year later they won the Asia Cup T20 in Bangladesh but exited the home T20 World Cup in the semi-final, though Dhoni enjoyed a good tournament as a finisher, scoring 89 runs while only being dismissed once in five innings, and showing electric reflexes while keeping to the spinners. He eventually played on till the 2019 World Cup (but gave up the white-ball captaincy in January 2017). India's defeat to New Zealand in the semi-final of the 2019 World Cup turned out to be Dhoni's final international, although that wasn't officially confirmed till more than a year later, when after Covid brought sport to a halt, he announced it on Instagram just as players' preparations for that year's delayed IPL began.In that tournament, Dhoni has been the face of the Chennai Super Kings franchise, inspiring fierce cult fandom. When Super Kings were reinstated in 2018 after two seasons out serving a suspension, he was back at the helm, leading the team to a fairy-tale third title, and he almost repeated the feat in 2019, when CSK lost a thrilling final against Mumbai Indians by just one run. Dhoni led them to their third title win in 2021, and repeated the feat in 2023, making CSK the league's most successful franchise, alongside Mumbai."
Shardul Thakur,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/322600/322696.png",Chennai Super Kings,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Bowler,"Shardul Thakur IPL factfile- Shardul Thakur was acquired for INR 20 lakh in the 2014 IPL auction by Kings XI Punjab (KXIP, now Punjab Kings) and made his IPL debut in 2015. But he played just one game that season before being released in IPL 2016.- Thakur was traded to Rising Pune Supergiant (RPSG) in 2017 and then went to Chennai Super Kings (CSK) at the IPL 2018 auction for INR 2.4 crore - this was after he had made his international debut. He stayed with CSK for four seasons from 2018 to 2021.- The 2021 season was Thakur's most fruitful in the IPL, where he finished joint-third on the purple cap list with 21 wickets in 16 matches.- Thakur was picked up for a whopping INR 10.75 crore by Delhi Capitals (DC) in the IPL 2022 auction and was then traded to Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) ahead of IPL 2023. - Thakur, a two-time IPL winner with CSK in 2018 and 2021, will return to his old franchise for IPL 2024 after being acquired in the auction for INR 4 crore.Shardul Thakur player profileAn aggressive quick bowler, who can swing the ball away from the right-handers even while hitting the pitch hard, Shardul Thakur has established himself as the spearhead of Mumbai's attack. With the new ball, Thakur's at-the-batsman method forms a neat counterpoint to Dhawal Kulkarni's more metronomic style, and the two combined brilliantly to win Mumbai their 41st Ranji Trophy title in February 2016. Thakur picked up eight wickets in the final against Saurashtra, and his dismissal of Cheteshwar Pujara on the third day, the ball rearing up from a length to hit the shoulder of the bat, was perhaps the ball of the match.Thakur hails from Palghar, a town 87 km north of Mumbai, and spent his early cricketing years lugging his kitbag on early-morning trains into the city. Mumbai won the Ranji Trophy in his debut season of 2012-13, but he did not play a major role in the triumph, picking up only four wickets in four matches at an average of 82.Told to lose weight by his Mumbai team-mates, Thakur came back leaner and fitter the next season, and picked up 27 wickets at 26.25. The 2014-15 season was even better, Thakur finishing joint-top of the Ranji Trophy bowling charts with 48 wickets at 20.81. That earned him a call-up to the India A squad for four-day games against Australia A and South Africa A. Later that year, playing for the Board President's XI, he bagged a four-wicket haul against the touring South Africans, his wickets including those of Faf du Plessis and Hashim Amla.Kings XI Punjab signed Thakur for INR 20 lakhs at the 2014 IPL player auction, but he only got to play one match in his first two seasons for the team.

His first season was for Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) after which he was part of Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in 2014 and 2015. He rejoined RCB in 2016, missed IPL 2017 because of injury, and then represented Punjab Kings (PBKS, previously known as Kings XI Punjab or KXIP) from 2018 to 2021. Rahul moved to Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) in IPL 2022.- A versatile batter who started in the middle order before moving to the top, Rahul also keeps wicket in the IPL, and has emerged as one of the league's most consistent run-scorers, with more than 590 runs in each season from 2018 to 2022.- In IPL 2018, Rahul smashed a fifty off 14 balls against Delhi Daredevils, which was the record for the fastest half-century in the IPL at the time.- In IPL 2020, Rahul won the Orange Cap for the most runs in the season: 670.- Rahul was named captain of Punjab Kings in IPL 2020 - his first captaincy stint in the IPL - and he led them for two years before moving to LSG, where he was appointed captain once again. Under Rahul's leadership, LSG qualified for the playoffs in their first two IPL seasons, though Rahul played only nine matches in IPL 2023 because of a thigh injury.- With four centuries, ahead of IPL 2024 Rahul is second only to Virat Kohli among Indian batters with the most hundreds in the Indian Premier League.KL Rahul player profileA tall, elegant right-hand batter who can keep wicket in a crisis, KL Rahul is among the most highly rated opening batters in India's next generation. Rahul was a part of India's squad in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup and made his first-class debut later that year. Having taken a while to establish himself as a first-class cricketer, he enjoyed a breakthrough 2013-14 season, laying the foundation for Karnataka's Ranji Trophy victory with 1033 runs, which included three centuries, three nineties, and a Man-of-the-Match performance in the final.Rahul attracted plenty of attention at the subsequent IPL auction, and finally went to Sunrisers Hyderabad for Rs. 1 crore (US$ 166,000 approx.). He was a regular member of their side in the 2014 season, mostly as wicketkeeper-batter, but his contributions with the bat were steady rather than spectacular.In the long format, however, his technique and application have impressed some of Indian cricket's most respected names. These include Rahul Dravid, with whom Rahul shares not just a name but also a strong rapport, regularly seeking him out for technical and mental advice.Rahul had a middling tour of Australia with the India A team in July-August 2014, getting starts each time he batted in the unofficial Tests but only managing a top score of 52. But his appetite for runs was back to normal by the time the 2014-15 domestic season began, and twin centuries in the Duleep Trophy final earned him a place in India's Test squad on their tour of Australia.A profitable IPL in 2016 set him up to make the Indian ODI and T20 squad that toured Zimbabwe in June, where he became the first batter from his country to score a century on debut in 50-over cricket.Karthik Krishnaswamy"

However, playing in the middle order as opposed to his preferred opening role, he could not replicate his success from previous years, scoring 376 runs from 17 innings. - He had another lean season with RR in 2023, scoring 261 runs from 11 innings, and was traded to Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) ahead of IPL 2024.Devdutt Padikkal player profilePadikkal first came to attention in 2020 as a 20-year-old after a breakout domestic season where he was the top run-getter in both white-ball tournaments, and then winning the emerging-player award in his debut IPL season, racking up 473 runs. At 6ft 3in, left-hander Padikkal, primarily an opener, is able to use his height and reach to meet good-length balls on the rise. He took his first-season form into the 2020-21 Vijay Hazare Trophy, in which he became the first Indian batter to score four consecutive List A hundreds. He made over 400 runs in the 2021 IPL as well, and it led to an India call-up, in Sri Lanka. But just when Padikkal's career was taking off, an acute intestinal issue struck him, affecting his form and fitness for two years. After two middling seasons with Rajasthan Royals, where he shuttled up and down the order, he was traded to Lucknow Super Giants ahead of the 2024 IPL. He found his feet again just before that, becoming Karnataka's top run-getter in the 2023-24 Vijay Hazare Trophy and following it up with four hundreds in six first-class games."
Marcus Stoinis,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/321500/321596.png",Lucknow Super Giants,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Batting Allrounder,"Marcus Stoinis player profileA powerful, versatile batter and medium-pace bowler, Marcus Stoinis has been a mainstay in Australia's limited-overs sides, a dominant presence in the BBL, and a sought-after IPL performer. Stoinis debuted for his home state, Western Australia, at 19, but found opportunities limited there and moved to Victoria, where he got a run in their Sheffield Shield side in 2013-14 and produced an outstanding 170 against Tasmania, a breakthrough innings that led to him becoming a regular in the top order. Stoinis was Victoria's leading run-scorer in the 2014-15 Sheffield Shield season and was called up to Australia's squad for limited-overs matches against England in 2015, where he debuted, playing an ODI and a T20I. He next played an international about a year and a half later, having impressed in first-class cricket in the interim. In his second ODI, Stoinis took three wickets and scored 146 not out from No. 7 to help Australia almost pull off an unlikely victory against New Zealand at Eden Park. That innings gave him an unbroken run in the white-ball sides for about four years, during which time he cemented his position as one of the team's top finishers. That is also the role he has played in the IPL, featuring in all of Delhi Capitals' games in their run to the final in 2020, and doing likewise with Lucknow Super Giants in 2023. In between, Stoinis helped guide Australia to a win in the 2021 T20 World Cup, putting on a remarkable stand of 81 with Matthew Wade in the semi-final against Pakistan after Australia were in strife at 96 for 5 chasing 177. In the BBL, on the other hand, he has been an opener for Melbourne Stars.Stoinis moved back to Western Australia in 2017 for family reasons and was a regular in the first-class side for three seasons, though his returns were middling; he next played when he briefly figured in the title-winning WA side in 2022-23. Marcus Stoinis IPL factfile- Marcus Stoinis came into the IPL after Delhi Capitals (DC, then Delhi Daredevils) bought him for INR 25 lakh before IPL 2015, but he did not get a game that season. Punjab Kings (PBKS, then Kings XI Punjab) snapped him up for INR 55 lakh in the IPL 2016 auction after that.- An allrounder who can hit the long ball is a valued asset in T20s, and Stoinis saw his stocks rise soon. Kings took back Stoinis by using the Right-to-Match option for INR 6.2 crore after putting him back into the IPL 2017 auction pool.- After two middling campaigns, Stoinis was traded to Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), but failed to nail down a spot. DC signed him again in 2020, and in his first season back, he scored 352 runs as they reached the final.- Ahead of the IPL 2022 auction, Stoinis was one of Lucknow Super Giants' (LSG) pre-auction picks, and helped them make the playoffs in both their first two seasons. He was crucial for them in IPL 2023, forming a mighty middle order with Nicholas Pooran. He scored 408 runs at a strike rate of 150 and chipped in with five wickets."
Deepak Hooda,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/345000/345083.png",Lucknow Super Giants,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,"An allrounder who can bat in any position, Deepak Hooda also bowls offbreaks, offers plenty of athleticism as a boundary fielder, and is an asset in any T20 side. His big hitting as a 19-year-old in his debut IPL season, in 2015, earned with the nickname ""Hurricane Hooda"", but more importantly, got him a Rs 4.2 crore (US$ 622,000 approx) contract with Sunrisers Hyderabad at the next auction. Hooda's game is also suited to the longer formats. Appointed Baroda's captain at the start of the 2016-17 Ranji season, he reeled off three consecutive hundreds, including an unbeaten 293 against Punjab, but struggled to convert his starts thereafter. In 2021, Baroda suspended him for indiscipline after he left the T20 squad, having accused captain Krunal Pandya of ""bullying"" and using abusive language. He moved to Rajasthan the next season.But Hooda patched things up with Pandya before the start of the 2022 IPL, and had a breakout season for Lucknow Super Giants under Pandya's captaincy. Immediately after, he scored his maiden T20I hundred - in only his third innings - against Ireland in Malahide and found himself included in the 2022 T20 World Cup squad."
Nicholas Pooran,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/320100/320109.png",Lucknow Super Giants,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Nicholas Pooran player profileNicholas Pooran confirmed his status as one of the most exciting young batting talents in the modern game with a sublime innings of 118 off 103 in West Indies' defeat to Sri Lanka at the 2019 World Cup, but only four years earlier the idea that he would play international cricket seemed fanciful.A year after finishing as the fourth-highest run-scorer at the U-19 World Cup in early 2014, Pooran was involved in a serious car accident which left him with a torn patella tendon, fractured tibia and fractured ankle. After a long recovery process, he was handy a substantial contract for Barbados Tridents in the 2016 CPL on Kieron Pollard's recommendation. Unsure whether his body would continue to hold up, Pooran looked to maximise his earnings by playing in every franchise league he could including the BPL, the PSL, the Hong Kong Blitz, the T10 and for West Indies B in the Global T20 Canada. His first BPL deal, in 2016-17, earned him a ban from the WICB, who were displeased at his decision not to play regional cricket instead.His international breakthrough came in late 2018, when he hit his first half-century for West Indies off just 24 balls against India in Chennai. From there, he was parachuted into the World Cup squad, and given an opportunity as West Indies' No. 4 despite limited experience in 50-over cricket. He hit fifties against England and Afghanistan, plus a thrilling hundred against Sri Lanka, and finished the tournament with an average of 52.47 and a strike rate of 100.After an underwhelming first season for Kings XI Punjab in the IPL - he was previously picked up by Mumbai Indians in 2017 but did not play a game - he enjoyed a stellar 2020 season in the UAE, making 353 runs at a strike rate of 170, demonstrating his ability to dominate against spin and also pulling off a remarkable boundary save in the deep. He had come into the season off the back of a maiden T20 hundred for Guyana Amazon Warriors in the CPL, and followed it by playing his first first-class games in over six years for West Indies A in New Zealand.ESPNcricinfo staffNicholas Pooran IPL factfile- An explosive left-handed batter, Nicholas Pooran made his IPL debut after being picked by Punjab Kings (PBKS) for INR 4.2 crore in 2019.- Pooran showed glimpses of his talent in his first season, scoring 168 runs from seven games at a strike rate of 157. He went even better in the next season as he made 353 runs in 14 games at 169.71.- He was released by PBKS after a poor season in 2021, when he could only score 85 runs in 12 matches. Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) then acquired him for INR 10.75 crore in the IPL 2022 mega auction.- Pooran crossed the 300-run mark for the second time in his IPL career in 2022, but was released by SRH and sparked a bidding war at the following auction, attracting interest from CSK, RR and DC, but was eventually snapped up for a whopping INR 16 crore by Lucknow Super Giants (LSG).- He made an instant impact for LSG, blazing 358 runs at a remarkable strike rate of 172.95 in 2023, helping the team make the playoffs."

Henry would make his Test debut at Lord's on the subsequent tour of England and made an immediate impression taking 4 for 93 in the first innings. Over the next four years his body held up well as he was a fairly regular member of New Zealand's Test and ODI sides and played the occasional T20I. In 2019, he was a key part of New Zealand's incredible World Cup campaign. He took 14 wickets, including 4 for 47 against Bangladesh. But he saved his best spell for the winning semi-final at Old Trafford where he ripped through India's top order, claiming 3 for 37 including the tournament's leading scorer Rohit Sharma. He also took the key wicket of Jason Roy in the epic final against England at Lord's.

It took him time and persistence, but by the 2010s he had become a colossus in white-ball cricket, and the man in charge of perhaps the most formidable league team in the first age of T20.That Rohit had talent was apparent to both the casual observer and to the trained eye. Fans were frustrated at the long wait for the potential to translate into runs, though selectors and captains, knowing better, kept backing him. At one point the word ""talent"" was Rohit's bugbear, a pejorative nickname for him on social media. Once it all clicked, though - the move to open the batting in ODIs late in 2012 was one particular turning point - things came together spectacularly.Rohit scored ODI double-hundreds for fun, won six IPLs in the first 15 editions of the tournament, scored five hundreds at the 2019 ODI World Cup, and when he finally got to open in Tests in 2019, three quick hundreds in his first series in the role, one of them a double. Ironically his IPL franchise nicknamed him ""Hitman"" when he was anything but: more caresser, less hitter. But Rohit still became known as one of the foremost hitters of colossal sixes of his era. So spectacular and certain was his acceleration that people began anticipate a massive score every time he went past 50.His captaincy at Mumbai Indians, whom he led to five titles, won plaudits. He proved himself a methodical, studious and calm leader, one not averse to using technology and data to arrive at decisions. He was an able deputy to Virat Kohli in limited-overs formats in international cricket, winning India two titles in Kohli's absence, and took over as captain in all formats in 2022.Rohit Sharma IPL factfile- Rohit Sharma has won six IPL titles: one with Deccan Chargers and five as captain of Mumbai Indians (MI), making him the joint most successful captain in the Indian Premier League.- He joined Mumbai in 2011 and became captain in 2013. He took them to their maiden IPL title in his first season as captain and went on to lead MI for 11 years before he was replaced by Hardik Pandya for the 2024 season.- Rohit is MI's top-scorer and one of only four batters with more than 6000 runs in the IPL. His only hundred - 109* against Kolkata Knight Riders - came in IPL 2012.- Rohit's best IPL season with the bat was in 2013, when he scored 538 runs in MI's title-winning campaign. In 2015, Rohit was the Player of the Final as Mumbai beat Chennai Super Kings to win their second IPL title. MI went on to win the IPL in 2017, 2019 and 2020 under Rohit's leadership"

He also has a yen for making batting look easy, as he showed during four golden years with Mumbai Indians starting in 2018, during which they won the IPL title twice, thanks in no small part to his 1700-plus runs at a strike rate of around 140.He made 73 on his Ranji Trophy debut, for Mumbai in 2010, and the following season scored 754 from nine games, the most by anyone from his team. That tally included a double-century against Orissa in his third match of the season, and a hundred in the next. He capped the season with yet another hundred, in the Duleep Trophy. After a blip in 2012-13, he was back among the runs the next season, where he finished among Mumbai's top three run-getters.Suryakumar spent four seasons with Kolkata Knight Riders, starting in their second IPL title-winning year, 2014, though with 608 runs from 54 games he didn't quite provide a foretaste of what he would go on to do with Mumbai Indians in the years that followed.  Suryakumar's first international came belatedly in 2021, whereupon he hooked the first ball he faced in a T20I, from Jofra Archer, for six. He produced two fifties in his first three T20Is, and the year after, made 117 off 55 in a game where India fell short in the face of a massive 215 by England.Suryakumar Yadav IPL factfile- Suryakumar Yadav, also known as SKY, is one of the most inventive and explosive batters in T20 cricket, drawing comparisons with AB de Villiers for his 360-degree range of shots.- SKY was part of the MI squad in the 2012 and 2013 seasons but played only one game, in which he was dismissed for a duck.- In 2014, SKY was bought by Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) but they failed to get the best out of him. He played for KKR for four years and did not score more than 200 runs in any IPL season.- In the 2018 IPL auction, MI bought SKY once again and he had his breakthrough season, scoring 512 runs at a strike rate of 133.33.- Since then, SKY has become a force at No. 3 and enjoyed his best IPL season in 2023, when he smashed 605 runs at a strike rate of 181.14. He has won two titles with MI, in 2019 and 2020."

His most memorable knock was a 99 in a Super Over loss against Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB).- After a quiet IPL 2021, Kishan crossed the 400-run mark in the two seasons that followed, as he formed a formidable opening partnership with Rohit Sharma. The two have the highest number of 50-plus partnerships in the IPL (16).Ishan Kishan player profileA wicketkeeper and left-handed opening batsman from Jharkhand, the same state MS Dhoni hails from, Ishan Kishan led India at the Under-19 World Cup in 2016 in Bangladesh, where his team finished runners-up to West Indies.Even though India had a successful tournament, Kishan struggled for form on seamer-friendly tracks, scoring just 73 runs in six innings.He was first noticed when he struck a 69-ball 87, studded with eight sixes, on a rank Rajkot turner in a Ranji Trophy clash against Saurashtra in October 2015. He then led India Under-19s to a one-day tri-series win in Sri Lanka, also involving the hosts and England, two months later.  He had made his first-class debut for Jharkhand in December 2014 and scored a century and five fifties in his first ten first-class matches.His attacking approach to batting had him picked by Gujarat Lions in the 2016 IPL auction for INR 35 lakh ($US 52,000 approx) at the age of 17."
Hardik Pandya,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/319900/319938.png",Mumbai Indians,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Allrounder,"Hardik Pandya player profileAllrounder Hardik Pandya's calling cards brisk seam bowling and powerful ball-striking marked by the ability to hit sixes from the first ball. Hardik, who plays his domestic cricket for Baroda, first caught the eye with an unbeaten 31-ball 61 for Mumbai Indians against Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2015 IPL. That began a long association with Mumbai, where he won four trophies and gained acclaim as a formidable finisher. By the end of the 2022 T20 World Cup, he had come to be seen as a future India captain, thanks to the leadership skills he showed that year in turning an unfancied Gujarat Titans line-up into IPL champions in their first year of existence. Hardik began his India career in 2016 when he was called up for a limited-overs tour to Australia, before impressing with the ball on seamer-friendly pitches in Bangladesh at the Asia Cup. He appeared to be the answer to India's search for a seam-bowling allrounder, and with his sprightly fielding added to the mix, he sealed his spot in India's squad for that year's T20 World Cup. While Hardik batted only twice in the tournament, he bowled the last over against Bangladesh, defending two runs off three balls to help India to a one-run win. A little more than a week after that, Pandya endured the disappointment of bowling a no-ball to reprieve Lendl Simmons, whose unbeaten innings helped eventual champions West Indies clinch the semi-final.Since then, it has not been all smooth sailing. The impact of a serious back injury in 2018 continues to follow Hardik, sometimes limiting him from being able to bowl. And early in 2019, he was embroiled in controversy when he made misogynistic and racist remarks on a talk show, for which he was pulled up by the Indian board.In the 2020s, Hardik grew into his role as a senior player and won praise for his faith in players as a captain and for being a free-thinker. In 2022, after India beat Pakistan in the T20 World Cup, he said he wouldn't have minded losing because the match was so much fun - sentiments he echoed after the 2023 IPL final, where he was all praise for rival captain MS Dhoni, whose Chennai Super Kings beat Gujarat Titans for the title. That year, like in the one before, Hardik turned in an impressive all-round and captaincy performance, making 346 runs and taking nine wickets in Gujarat Titans' run to their second final in a row.Hardik Pandya IPL factfile- Hardik Pandya is part of a rare species in Indian cricket - a genuine seam-bowling allrounder - and he was unearthed by Mumbai Indians (MI) in IPL 2015.- Hardik spent his first seven IPL seasons at Mumbai, developing into one of the world's best allrounders, and was part of their title wins in 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2020. After injuries began to hinder his ability to bowl, Hardik was released by Mumbai after the 2021 season.- Ahead of IPL 2022, Hardik was signed by new franchise Gujarat Titans (GT) and was appointed their captain even though he had never led any team previously. In his first season as captain, Hardik led Titans to the IPL title and then captained them to the final once again in IPL 2023.- After two successful years at Titans, Hardik was traded back to Mumbai ahead of IPL 2024, and he was appointed MI captain, replacing long-time leader Rohit Sharma.- Hardik's best season as an allrounder was in IPL 2019, when he scored 402 runs at a strike rate of 191.41 and took 14 wickets in Mumbai's title-winning campaign. In 2022, he was the highest run-scorer (487) for Titans as they won their maiden IPL title."

As a 15-year-old he represented India Under-19 and Uttar Pradesh U-22. Before he made his first-class debut, at 17, he had already bowled Sachin Tendulkar with a googly in a Challenger Series match. In his first first-class season, he took 35 wickets and scored 224 runs to help UP win their first Ranji Trophy. In his teens he played two Test matches too, against England and South Africa. He took three wickets on ODI debut in Bangladesh in 2007, and 14 during India's tour of Ireland and England the same year, often troubling Kevin Pietersen with the googlies and the straighter ones.Chawla is a legspinner who has good control and variations, but can do with a bigger stock legbreak to make the other aspects of his bowling more effective. He has not been able to make himself a permanent place in the Indian team so far, losing out to a more conventional legspinner Amit Mishra after Anil Kumble retired from Tests. He stayed closer to the ODI team, also helped by an impressive performance in the first IPL. But after an ordinary Asia Cup in Pakistan in 2008, he was sent back to domestic cricket to work on his game. After a long time in the side-lines, when the likes of Amit Mishra and Pragyan Ojha overtook him in the Indian spinner stakes, Chawla made a surprise comeback to the side when he was included for the World Twenty20 in 2010, and then made it to the squad for the 2011 World Cup.Cricinfo Staff"

The journey was far from easy for Bairstow, especially with Jos Buttler in contention for the gloves, but prolific run-making for Yorkshire eventually made a case that England's selectors could not ignore. Galvanised by his selection, runs flowed.Bairstow's wicketkeeping has rarely met with universal approval and, much to his chagrin, the debate about whether he might be better playing as a specialist batter has never been silenced. But from the moment that he delivered an emotional maiden Test century in Cape Town, where his father had strong off-season links, he began to make a significant mark with England. Nothing could compare with his impact on the one-day team, where his peerless opening partnership with Jason Roy helped deliver England a first World Cup success in 2019.He has had to fight against a tendency to play across the line and, to that end, he stands tall, bat held aloft, adding to his pugnacious image. Driven and independently minded, he is very much his own man. Intensive work with Bruce French, England's wicketkeeping coach, has also made his keeping more secure.Bairstow was a talented all-round sportsman at an early age, even having trials with Leeds United as a right back. But it was cricket which soon dominated. An early starter with Yorkshire's Under-15s, he was named Young Wisden Schools Cricketer of the Year in 2007, having already played for Yorkshire's 2nd XI and their Academy side and represented England Under-17. He soon followed in his father's footsteps by signing a full-time contract with Yorkshire. Jonny was eight-years-old when his father took his own life. Merely to play the game, and for the same county, was courageous enough.He made an impressive first-class debut against Somerset in June 2009, cracking 82 in his second innings, and soon secured his place in the first XI. Further honours followed when he was picked up by England's Performance Programme and included in the England Lions successful tour of the Caribbean in January 2011.By now Yorkshire's first-choice keeper, he registered his maiden first-class hundred against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in May of that year. Having previously passed fifty 17 times in 34 first-class matches without reaching three figures, just to emphasise his breakthrough, he made it a double. During his brilliant attacking innings, he was joined by England's recently retired opening bowler Ryan Sidebottom in a record ninth-wicket partnership for Yorkshire against Nottinghamshire (which had stood since 1899) of 151. Bairstow and Sidebottom were sons of two of Yorkshire's best-loved former players - the passing of talent between the generations could not have been more satisfactorily captured.Many suspected that, long term, Bairstow would become a specialist batter and his debut innings in one-day internationals backed up that theory as he hit an unbeaten 41 off 21 balls against India at Cardiff. A tough India tour showed the realities of international cricket but he bounced back with a match-winning 60 off 46 in a T20I against Pakistan in the UAE and, after a strong start to the 2012 season, he was handed a call-up to the Test squad to face West Indies.It was not a happy series for Bairstow, whose problems against some hostile short bowling from Kemar Roach gained much media attention. He was left out of the opening Test of the South Africa series but, after Kevin Pietersen was dropped in extraordinary circumstances, another opportunity arose for Bairstow to which he responded magnificently. His brilliant 95 at Lord's led an England fightback from 54 for 4, Bairstow emerging from a short-ball peppering to play some fluent attacking shots in an innings former England captain Michael Vaughan said would have been the finest maiden Test century he had witnessed had his fellow Yorkshireman not been bowled by Morne Morkel.He played all five of England's games at the World T20 that winter, averaging just 9.50, and his participation in the India Test series was also limited before he was granted leave to return home because of a family illness. Thereafter his bit-part status congealed - he lost his spot in the T20 team and, after returning to the Test team during the Ashes as England dropped Nick Compton and moved Joe Root up the order, he was abruptly left out at The Oval. A squad member for the return tour of Australia, he played in the last two Tests, replacing the out-of-form Matt Prior, but did not unearth the performances to promote his worth as Prior's long-term successor and had to buckle down to the county circuit the following summer.That 2015 season promised to be the making of him as he struck 1108 first-class runs at 92.33, allowed by Yorkshire to play as he saw fit. Nothing was more emphatic than his 366-run alliance with Tim Bresnan at Chester-le-Street, both players making career-bests in Yorkshire's fifth-highest stand of all time. England were receptive. A combative 83 not out at Chester-le-Street after a late summons settled a weather-hit ODI against New Zealand in England's favour and the faltering form of Buttler brought a Test recall against Australia.It was Cape Town, though, where Bairstow really broke through, as the summer of 2016 testified. Bairstow's second Test ton was reserved for his home crowd against Sri Lanka: 140, batting at No. 7, out of 298. On a challenging surface, he played with a certainty not given to others. England's top order was repeatedly found wanting in Test cricket, but the belligerence of Bairstow and co down the order constantly dug them out of a hole, and another hundred at Lord's followed.His desire was relentless and his growing impact in ODIs was enough for him to return at the top of the order in the Champions Trophy semi-final - a defeat against Pakistan in Cardiff. West Indies felt his frustration at the end of the summer in the form of his first two ODI hundreds.But even as he became increasingly integral to England's white-ball fortunes, vagaries of selection hurt his Test chances. He scored an Ashes hundred on the 2017-18 tour and another in Christchurch a few months later, but pushed up the order to cover for deficiencies in others, his form dipped; he lost the gloves to Ben Foakes due to injury in Sri Lanka - though scored a bristling century when asked to bat as a specialist at No. 3 - and then saw the role handed to Buttler following a 2-2 draw in the 2019 Ashes.Back-to-back hundreds in crunch World Cup group games against New Zealand and India had been pivotal on England's route to the trophy, his opening partnership with Roy already among the most prolific in history. He enhanced his reputation further in the IPL, but in Tests he drifted to the periphery. Ed Smith, the national selector, suggested he needed to work on his red-ball game but rarely did he have the opportunity to do so; a comeback in 2021 only meeting with fitful success.ESPNcricinfo staffJonny Bairstow IPL factfile- Jonny Bairstow made his IPL debut for Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in 2019, and quickly formed a destructive opening pair with David Warner. -  He and Warner had four century stands that year, the most by an opening pair in a single IPL edition. - Bairstow ended the season with 445 runs from ten games, at an average of 55.62 and a strike rate of 157.24. -  SRH released him ahead of the 2022 mega auction, where he was picked up by Punjab Kings. -  Bairstow's first season with Kings was lukewarm, as he scored only 253 runs in 11 games.-   He missed IPL 2023 with a leg injury."
Sam Curran,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383100/383153.png",Punjab Kings,Left hand Bat,Left arm Medium fast,Allrounder,"Sam Curran, younger brother of Tom Curran, his fellow Surrey all-rounder, and son of the former Zimbabwe cricketer Kevin Curran, fulfilled his destiny at the age of 19 years and 363 days, when he made his Test debut against Pakistan at Headingley in June 2018. One Test later, he scooped his maiden Man-of-the-Match award, after four first-innings wickets and a thrilling counter-attacking half-century had given England the edge in a gripping Edgbaston Test against India. His success merely heightened the debate as to whether batting or bowling will ultimately become his strongest suit. Perhaps the only real conclusion to that debate is it does not matter. Curran has developed into an X-factor cricketer of global repute. He was player of the T20 World Cup in 2022, taking 13 wickets at 11.38, with an economy rate of 6.52, emerging as a canny death bowler to take England to glory. He signed off with a player of the match performance in the final against Pakistan, taking 3 for 12. Punjab Kings subsequently made him the most expensive buy at an IPL auction, outbidding five other teams to acquire his services for INR 18.50 crore (Â£1.85 million approximately). Back in 2018, the same franchise - Kings XI Pubjab, as they were known at the time - purchased him for INR 7.2 crore (Â£800,000 approximately). It was at the IPL, while playing for Chennai Super Kings, he showed his dexterity as a makeshift opening batter, having primarily been used as a hitter down the order. His absence from Test duties in 2022 was more through circumstance than design. A back injury ruled him out of the 2021/22 Ashes which took time to shake off. Now, however, both player and national team are aligned. As a leftie in both disciplines, his skillset is a rarity as far as English red ball bowling stocks are concerned, and his composure with bat in hand has never been questioned. Having fallen in the nineties twice in first class cricket, he finally made it to three figures in June 2022 with 126 against Kent. It was his 120th innings in the format. Curran has belied his slight frame from the moment he entered Surrey's 1st X1 in 2015, showing a natural ability to swing his left-armers at a decent lick and full of ambition at the crease. The combative nature of his cricket marked him down as a special cricketer in the making, winning attention from England Lions at the end of the 2016 season.Curran made an eye-catching Championship debut against Kent at The Oval when he took five wickets in the first innings, eight in all in the match, at only 17. Surrey research suggested he was the youngest-ever player to achieve a five-wicket haul in the Championship and the second youngest Surrey debutant. He opened the bowling with his brother, Tom, and took a wicket with his fifth ball when an inswinger bowled Joe Denly. At 17 years and 40 days old, his first-class debut came 69 years to the day after Tony Lock, the youngest player to play for Surrey at 17 years and eight days, made his first appearance - also against Kent - at the Oval on July 13, 1946. He showed an ability to swing the ball into the right-hander from the outset. That there was aggression, too, was evident even before his debut when he filled in for a Surrey T20 practice match and struck Gary Wilson on the helmet with one of the first balls he bowled. His laid-back personality was also evident when he was given a day off school by Wellington College, where he was taking A levels in PE, Art and Business Studies, to play in a Royal London Cup semi-final against Nottinghamshire at The Oval, where he first came to the attention of a wider audience with a composed, energetic display.Two successive runners-up medals in the Royal London Cup final, as Surrey lost Lord's finals against Gloucestershire and Warwickshire, were not a bad start for a player still only 18, but such is Curran's competitive nature, it is doubtful that he found much consolation in either of them. In a 2016 summer that brought so much to admire with bat and ball, there was a 96 against Lancashire - ended when a tame return catch to the offspinner Arron Lilley was followed by a disconsolate walk from the crease, in the words of ESPNcricinfo's reporter, as if he had just lost a game of Pokemon Go - and four wickets in seven ball against Durham on the way to the first six-for of his Championship career.

He is a short, skiddy quick with an excellent yorker and superb change of pace.In 2019 he was a club cricketer who had moved to Tasmania from New South Wales in search of opportunity and worked a variety of jobs including a landscape gardener, a labourer and a teacher's aide.He forced his way into the Tasmania set up and in 2020-21 enjoyed a breakout BBL campaign for Hobart Hurricanes. By the middle of 2021 he was on Australia duty and on his T20I debut against Bangladesh in Mirpur claimed a hat-trick. A few months later he picked up an IPL deal with Punjab Kings and was a reserve in Australia's 2021 T20 World Cup squad.He has rarely failed to impress in Australia's T20 side but the strength of their pace bowling has made it a struggle to string games together. Globally, he has enjoyed further IPL stints as well as T20 Blast and Hundred deals while remaining one of Hurricanes' key bowlers. In the 2023 calendar year he was the leading T20 wicket-taker in the world with 66, one ahead of Rashid Khan."

He burst onto the scene in domestic cricket as a 17-year-old scoring half-centuries on both his first-class and List A debuts for Victoria in November 2019. He was part of Australia's Under-19 World Cup team in South Africa 2020 but had to return home mid-tournament after being scratched by a monkey at a nature reserve on a day off. His domestic career stalled with Victoria over the next three years where he failed to score another half-century in any format, including in the BBL for Melbourne Renegades. He was only offered a rookie contract for the 2023-24 season and opted to move to South Australia on a full contract.That move reignited his career. In October 2023, he broke AB de Villiers' world record for the fastest List A century, scoring a hundred off 29 balls against Tasmania in a Marsh Cup game at Karen Rolton Oval to beat the previous record by two deliveries. The following month he made his first Sheffield Shield century against his old side Victoria. That propelled him to his best BBL season with Renegades where he smashed three half-centuries batting at No.3 and led him to secure an ILT20 contract with Dubai Capitals where he made 54 off 25 balls in his first game. In February 2024, he made his ODI debut for Australia and smashed 41 off 18 balls in his second game against the West Indies in Canberra. He was picked up in the IPL by Delhi Capitals as a replacement player after coach Ricky Ponting suggested Fraser-McGurk could be the ""next David Warner"" and play all three formats for Australia. Fraser-McGurk repaid Ponting's backing with a stunning IPL season making four half-centuries including two off 15 balls and one off 19. His 84 off 27 against Mumbai Indians just days before Australia's T20 World Cup squad was selected created a groundswell of support for him to be added to the 15-man squad but he missed out."

But few in the Caribbean doubted his talent as a batsman. Clive Lloyd gave him his West Indies cap, and coach Stuart Law insisted that he only needed one innings to get going. The world eventually got to know why the boy from Barbados was rated so highly when he became the first player, in 534 first-class matches, to score a hundred in each innings at Headingley.Hope was 23 at the time, the youngest member of the XI, leading West Indies to victory with scores of 147 and 118 not out. They had been faced with a target of 322 - not since Bradman's Invincibles rocketed to 404 for 3 in 1948 had a team chased that many on Yorkshire's storied turf, and won. Adding to the occasion was the fact West Indies had been dismantled only a week ago, England beating them by an innings and 209 runs to ensure their fans could savour the advent of day-night Test cricket in the country. Hope made his first-class debut in 2012-13, but propelled himself into consideration for the West Indies team after a superb season in 2014-15, when he scored 628 runs in nine matches - he was the fourth-highest run-getter in the tournament. He racked up 538 runs at 67.25 in 2015-16 - the highest average among the top-10 - and secured his maiden first-class double-hundred at his homeground, Kensington Oval, in March 2017ESPNcricinfo staff"
Rishabh Pant,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/323000/323036.png",Delhi Capitals,Left hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Rishabh Pant player profileA match-turning, swashbuckling batter-keeper in the Adam Gilchrist mould, Rishabh Pant has had a starring role in more than a handful of India's biggest Test matches in his first few years in the team.His first Test century came in his third match, on the 2018 tour of England, when he made 114 from No. 7 when up against a target of 464 that he made look almost gettable at points when he was at the crease. Early the following year he produced 159 off 189 balls in India's total of 622 in Sydney, which sealed their first series win in Australia. An encore followed early in 2021, when he made 97 off just 118 at the SCG, helping wrest a draw off Starc, Cummins, Lyon and Hazlewood when India were staring down the barrel. Pant's finest batting hour came in the classic that followed in Brisbane: an unbeaten 89 to steer a veritable India third XI home in a tall chase, and to their second series win down under in two visits. The whitewash of England at home that followed brought another two centuries for him, and in Cape Town at the start of 2022, he made an almost ludicrous 100 off 139 in an India total where the next highest score was 29. Later that year, he set India up with a breakneck 146 in the first innings of the postponed last Test of their tour of England from 2021 - only for England to outgun them in a berserker fourth-innings chase.In December 2022, Pant was seriously injured in a horrific car crash but he returned to the game 15 months later, in the 2024 IPL, leaner and more fit, his attacking fervour undiminished. It is a mark of Pant's no-fear, no-brakes batting that in his first four years in the game, he had as many scores between 90 and 100 in Tests as he did hundreds. It is the only way he has known: a year after making his Ranji Trophy debut at 18 in 2015, he scored a triple-hundred against Maharashtra, followed by two blistering centuries in a game against Jharkhand a month on - one of them ending in 135 off 67 balls.With Test stats like his, Pant's numbers in T20 - over 3000 runs in eight seasons for Delhi Capitals, at a strike rate of close to 150 - don't seem especially remarkable, but he has been a force for the Delhi side, their all-time top-scorer, and was appointed captain in 2021. He was bought at auction by the franchise the day he made a hundred in the 2016 Under-19 World Cup, which took India into the semi-finals of that tournament.Rishabh Pant IPL factfile - Rishabh Pant was bought by DC at the 2016 IPL auction, on the same day that he scored a century to seal India's place in the Under-19 World Cup semi-final, and he has remained with them ever since.- An attacking left-hand wicketkeeper-batter, Pant made a name for himself with his audacious stroke play and daredevil approach. His best season with the bat was in IPL 2018, when he scored 684 runs at a strike rate of 173.60.- In IPL 2019, Pant was DC's second highest run-scorer - 488 at a strike rate of 162.66 - as they qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 2012.- Pant was named DC's captain for IPL 2021, when Shreyas Iyer was injured, and had led the team to the top of the points table at the halfway stage before the season was disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic. When the season resumed later in 2021, DC decided to continue with Pant as their captain.- Pant returned to play IPL 2024 after recovering from severe injuries he suffered in a life-threatening car accident in December 2022. He was named captain of Delhi Capitals again after his return, and, back to his best, made 446 runs in yet another middling season for the team."

He played just one first-class game in his debut season for Gujarat, but had a more successful showing in 2013, when he was one of the key contributors to India Under-23s' title win in the ACC Emerging Teams Cup, with seven wickets, including a four-for in the semi-final against UAE. He was consistent for Gujarat with bat and ball in the Ranji Trophy that season, finishing with 369 runs at an average of 46.12 and 29 wickets at 23.58.Axar scored an IPL contract with Mumbai Indians ahead of the 2013 season but didn't get a game. He had a more impressive season the following year, after switching to Kings XI Punjab - 16 wickets at an economy rate of 6.22 - and was rewarded with a place in the Indian ODI squad for the tour to Bangladesh, though he only played one match.He made his T20 debut against Zimbabwe in 2015, but for the next three years found himself in and out of the limited-overs squads, stepping in more often than not in the absence of Ravindra Jadeja. His Test debut likewise came about when Jadeja was forced to sit out the 2021 England series with a broken thumb. Axar took five wickets on debut in the second Test in Chennai, and followed it up with an 11-wicket haul in the third: he finished the series with 27 wickets. In 2022, he made a 27-ball fifty, his first in ODIs, to seal a series win for India against West Indies.Axar Patel IPL factfile- Axar Patel was first signed by Mumbai Indians in IPL 2013 but did not get a game. He was then picked up for INR 75 lakh by Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings) in the IPL 2014 auction.- Axar had an immediate impact picking 17 wickets in as many games in his debut season, the joint-sixth-most in IPL 2014. He had a big role in taking Kings to the final for the first and so far, only time in the IPL. - In IPL 2016, Axar claimed a hat-trick, taking four wickets in five balls in a match against the now-defunct Gujarat Lions. - Axar stayed with Kings for five seasons till IPL 2018 before being released ahead of the 2019 auction. - Axar was picked for INR 5 crore by Delhi Capitals in the IPL 2019 auction and has stayed with them since. He was one of four players retained by Capitals ahead of the IPL 2022 mega auction for INR 9 crore."

When he eventually did take the game up, however, he progressed quickly through Afghanistan's age-group sides as a batting allrounder and was the youngest member of the team that won the Division Five tournament in 2008 - the first stepping stone to the full world stage.But Naib was dropped soon after, and had to deal with hardship in his personal life: his father was unemployed, his mother had hepatitis, and the family was struggling to deal with the needs of his disabled sister. Happily, Naib was able to force his way back into the national team in 2011 and settled into a floating role in Afghanistan's middle order, chipping in with both bat and ball. His maiden international fifty contributed to Afghanistan's first T20I series win over a Full Member, against Zimbabwe in October 2015. A few months later, he scored his first ODI fifty in a series win against the same opposition, to help Afghanistan break into the top ten in the ODI rankings. His biggest test came when he was promoted to captain the side for the 2019 World Cup; unfortunately Afghanistan failed to win a single game in the tournament."

The change wasn't smooth - Kuldeep admitted that he had even tried once - but he soon realised bowling left-arm wristspin was the way forward for him. And he was good at it too, having not only solid control over the length, but also a potent wrong'un among his variations.There haven't been too many bowlers of his ilk in India, and Kuldeep, therefore, attracted immediate attention after successful stints at the Under-19 level.Kuldeep played his first India U-19 game in April 2012 as a 17-year old and and despite consistently taking wickets, he stayed below the radar.  It was the 2014 edition of the U-19 World Cup in Dubai that pushed his stocks higher. After a wicketless spell in the opening game against Pakistan, Kuldeep picked up a hat-trick in the next game against Scotland. ""As Kuldeep, mere ko wicket nikaalna hai (As Kuldeep, I knew I had to take wickets),"" he said after the match.He gained in stature in the games that followed, repeatedly troubling batsmen with his turn and finished with 14 wickets, the joint second-highest in the tournament. The performance seemed to justify why Kolkata Knight Riders' scouts had forked out $66,000 for him in the IPL auction prior to the Under-19 World Cup.Kuldeep had been part of the Mumbai Indians set-up in the 2012 season where he had a fond memory of bamboozling Sachin Tendulkar once in the nets with his wrong'un. That did not translate into an IPL debut. Nor did it happen with Knight Riders in the 2014 season. He had to wait until the Champions League where, playing as a support bowler to Sunil Narine, he impressed with his economy. Following those performances, he was included in India's ODI squad for the series against West Indies in October 2014, and he made his first-class and List A debuts shortly after.Having established himself in the Uttar Pradesh and India A sides, Kuldeep made his Test debut against Australia in a deciding match in Dharamsala in March 2017 and claimed 4 for 68 in the first innings.ESPNcricinfo staffKuldeep Yadav IPL factfile- Kuldeep Yadav is the most successful left-arm wristspinner in the IPL. - He was first introduced by Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in 2016 in a continuation of their faith in left-arm wristspin, first starting alongside Brad Hogg and then replacing the veteran Australian.- His form fell away in the 2019 and 2020 seasons, and he missed IPL 2021 due to a knee injury before being let go by KKR.- In 2022, after six seasons with KKR, he was picked by Delhi Capitals (DC). The move seemed to work for him, 2022 being his most prolific IPL season: he took 21 wickets at a strike rate of 14.19, finishing in the tournament's top-five wicket-takers."

He couldn't quite extend that wicket-taking form into the World Cup, but was a regular presence in the side.Khaleel was bought by Delhi Daredevils for INR 10 lakh at the IPL auction in 2016, thereby extending his association with Rahul Dravid who served as India's Under-19 coach and is also the Daredevils' team mentor.

By 21, he shared the record for the most successive ODI centuries - three - before it was bettered by Kumar Sangakkara. A year later, he had established himself in all three formats for South Africa. De Kock grew up as a baseball player and even considered a move to the United States, but his father convinced him to pursue cricket instead. He attended King Edward VII High School, the alma mater of Graeme Smith and Neil McKenzie, and was picked for the South African U-19 side, which he captained briefly. He also topped the batting charts for South Africa in the 2012 junior World Cup in Australia.Later that year he caught the national selectors' eyes when he starred in a match-winning partnership with McKenzie in the Champions League T20 against Mumbai Indians. He also finished fourth in the first-class rankings in the 2012-13 season. After a bit of a false start to his international career - he didn't do much against New Zealand and Sri Lanka in 2012 and 2013 - he scored his first ODI hundred against Pakistan later that year. Then came the three in a row against India, followed by his Test debut early in 2014. An ankle injury threatened to put de Kock out of the 2015 World Cup, but he recovered quickly - if only to struggle through that tournament and a series against Bangladesh, after which he was dropped and spent some productive time in the A team. His first Test hundred came against England in Centurion in 2016, and he followed that up with one against Australia three matches later in Adelaide, in a series South Africa won 2-1. He also hit his stride in the shortest format, scoring his maiden half-century in the T20 World Cup that year, in which he was South Africa's most successful batter. Elsewhere in T20, he was a key part of the Mumbai Indians side that won two IPL titles on the trot at the tail end of the 2010s, opening their batting and keeping. In late 2021, de Kock announced a shock retirement from Tests, becoming another in a growing list of top all-format players seeking to concentrate on the white-ball formats.Quinton de Kock IPL factfile- Quinton de Kock made his IPL debut in 2013 for Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) but was only given three games. A quiet season followed in 2014 after he was bought by Delhi Capitals (then Delhi Daredevils).- In his second season with Delhi, he scored two half-centuries in three games and finally had his breakout season in 2016. He scored 445 runs, hitting his maiden century in the tournament as well.- After a disappointing season with Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in 2018, he was snapped up by Mumbai Indians (MI).- De Kock went past the 500-run mark both in 2019 and 2020, forming a dangerous opening partnership with Rohit Sharma to help Mumbai Indians win back-to-back titles.- New franchise Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) bought him at the IPL 2022 mega auction and he enjoyed a stellar season, scoring 508 runs as they made it to the playoffs.- He hammered a career-best unbeaten 140 not out off 70 against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in IPL 2022, as he and KL Rahul put on an unbroken 210 to break the record for the biggest opening partnership in the tournament's history."

For one who started playing serious cricket at 14, Ishant's rise was rapid and he made his Ranji Trophy debut at 18, followed by his first Test on India's tour of Bangladesh in May 2007, but it was in Australia that he made people sit up. He impressed also in the one-day CB Series there that season, which India won and in which he was their highest wicket-taker.He then took 15 wickets in the succesful home series against Australia in 2008, seven of them in the first Test, in Bangalore, and quickly became Zaheer Khan's deputy in India's fast-bowling line-up. Then, mystifyingly, over the two-odd seasons that followed, Ishant lost his pace, and without it, his short-of-a-good-length deliveries lost their venom. India's selectors gave him a long rope, through and after ankle surgery in 2012, which put him out of action for months, but 70 Tests into his career, Ishant averaged an unfortunate 37 with the ball.He did turn things around, though - almost miraculously, to the point where he averaged 23.4 in his last 34 Tests. He took nine wickets against New Zealand in Auckland in 2014, and followed it up with 7 for 74 in an India win at Lord's. He missed the ODI World Cup of 2015 with a knee injury and his white-ball career ended in Australia the following year, but his second coming in Tests proceeded at a nice clip. Eighteen wickets in the series in England in 2018 were followed by 11 in the first three Tests in Australia, of which India won two to pick up a historic first series win in that country. Ishant filled his boots against West Indies and Bangladesh in 2019, and was in the thick of things when England came to India in 2021, taking 15 wickets in the 3-1 win.In the IPL, he turned out for Kolkata Knight Riders in the first three seasons of the league before moving to Deccan Chargers and their successor team, Sunrisers Hyderabad. Though each of those sides won the IPL at least once in the first decade of the competition, Ishant wasn't in the team when they did. He bedded in for a longish stint with Delhi Capitals starting in 2019."

Jacks became the first England debutant spinner since 1993 to claim a five-for on Test debut in 2022, setting up a famous win in Rawalpindi. Not only was it his maiden first-class five-for, he was not even meant to be in the side: he was a late change to the side before the toss with Ben Foakes ruled out through illness.But though his offspin is more than serviceable, Jacks is primarily a powerful top-order batter who has long been tipped for the top. He shot to mainstream attention on Surrey's pre-season tour in 2019, when he hit a 25-ball hundred in a T10 friendly against Lancashire in Dubai, by which stage he had graduated from a spell with England's Under-19s which included a century against India in a Youth Test and the vice-captaincy at the 2018 World Cup.Jacks played for Surrey in all three formats in the Championship-winning season of 2018, at the age of 19, and by his early 20s was an established first-team regular. He earned his Test call-up for England's 2022 Pakistan tour after an impressive all-round season for Surrey, developing his offspin under head coach Gareth Batty's tutelage, and also won caps for the T20I and ODI teams. He was also the second man to score a century in the Hundred, playing for Oval Invincibles against defending champions Southern Brave.An injury sustained on tour in Bangladesh in early 2023 ruled him out of his first IPL season with Royal Challengers Bengaluru, but he continued to stake a strong claim for England's white-ball squads. He has dipped his toe into the T20 franchise circuit and in early 2024, he hit centuries in the SA20, BPL and IPL in the space of three months.

David Warner,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316500/316589.png",Delhi Capitals,Left hand Bat,Legbreak,Opening Batter,"David Warner's extraordinary batting feats in all three formats for Australia will forever be overshadowed by his role as the chief protagonist of the Newlands ball-tampering scandal of 2018 and his place as a central figure in Australian cricket's ensuing cultural crisis.After he was charged as the man who instructed team-mate Cameron Bancroft to use sandpaper on the ball in the infamous Cape Town Test, Warner, though not punished by the ICC, was banned from international and Australian domestic cricket by Cricket Australia for 12 months, stripped of the vice-captaincy, and banned from leadership roles for life.He returned for the 2019 World Cup and enjoyed a prolific tournament before suffering a record-breakingly poor Ashes, in which he made 95 runs in ten innings. He bounced back later that year with an unbeaten 335 against Pakistan in Adelaide - the second-highest Test score by an Australian - during a home summer in which he received the Allan Border Medal.He ended his international career in stages, playing his last ODI during Australia's triumphant 2023 campaign in India, his final Test against Pakistan in early 2024 and was set to finish altogether after the 2024 T20 World Cup.Prior to his ban, Warner had established himself as one of the best all-format openers in the world. In 2015 his seniority was recognised when he was named vice-captain to Steven Smith in the Test and ODI sides, and he led the limited-overs sides with great success when Smith was rested. It was quite a turnaround for the man who two years earlier had been suspended by Cricket Australia for punching England's Joe Root in a bar-room altercation in Birmingham, and had been warned over a Twitter spat with a pair of journalists. It completed a remarkable rise for a player who burst onto the international scene in 2008-09 as a T20 specialist - he was the first man since 1877 to debut for Australia before playing first-class cricket. His breathtaking 89 from 43 balls on T20I debut against South Africa told the world of his talent, but few at the time expected him to become a key Test player as well.His debut in the baggy green came, appropriately, in Test match No. 2020, against New Zealand at the Gabba in 2011, and in his second game he achieved what Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden never did, carrying his bat through a Test innings. His unbeaten 123 in Hobart could not prevent a historic New Zealand win, but his patience in challenging conditions showed a different side to his batting. Later that same summer he made a very different kind of hundred, a 69-ball one against India at the WACA. In the seven-year period between his debut and the ban, Warner was far and away the best Test opener in the world.Away from international cricket, he has had a prolific franchise T20 career, especially in the IPL, and in 2021 became just the fourth batter to pass 10,000 runs in T20. David Warner IPL factfile- David Warner is the most prolific overseas batter in the history of the IPL. - He was plucked out of obscurity in his first season in 2009 by Delhi Daredevils (now Capitals). He was with them till 2013.  - Warner moved to Sunrisers Hyderabad in 2014, was named captain in 2015 and won the title in 2016. - In 2018, he was banned from playing in the league for his involvement in the Newlands ball-tampering scandal - Warner has breached the 500-run mark in seven IPL seasons, which is the most for any batter. Six of them came back-to-back. - He has been an orange cap winner three times in the IPL - in 2015, 2017 and 2019 - a record, and has hit the most fifties in the league- Warner's relationship with SRH soured in 2021 and he was picked up again by DC in 2022"

Buttler helped bring England's limited-overs batting into the 21st century, his impact on the one-day and T20 sides extraordinary as they turned a group-stage exit in the 2015 World Cup into a triumph on home soil four years later, with his efforts with the bat and the gloves crucial to their Super-Over victory in the final. In an 18-month period from mid-2014, he scored what at the time were England's three fastest one-day hundreds - thrilling innings against Sri Lanka at Lord's, New Zealand at Edgbaston and, topping the list, a 46-ball onslaught against Pakistan in Dubai. He has also shone at the IPL, and quickly became a senior player in the Test side since his surprise recall in 2018.Softly-spoken and unassuming, with supple hands and a great eye, Buttler kills opposing attacks with kindness, with a graceful flip shot for six over long-on and the occasional resort to a nerveless ramp shot over the wicketkeeper among his most eye-catching shots in an inventive repertoire. Like his captain, Eoin Morgan, his unflustered response to even the most daunting run chase is one of his greatest assets, his steely resolve hidden beneath a benign exterior. Such was his impact for Mumbai Indians in his first appearance in IPL in 2016, capable of mayhem late in the innings, that for a young cricket follower in India with only Twenty20 in their heart, it was possible to imagine that England had rarely, if ever, produced a player of such star quality. As he entered his 30s, Buttler reached a new level in short-form cricket, becoming indisputably one of the world's best T20 batters. In 2022, he hit 863 runs in the IPL - the second-most in a single season - including four centuries to take Rajasthan Royals to the final. Later in the year, after taking over from Eoin Morgan as England's white-ball captain, he led them to their second men's T20 World Cup title as they achieved their long-stated ambition to hold both World Cups simultaneously. As Buttler and his old friend Alex Hales knocked off a target of 170 with four overs and 10 wickets to spare against India in the semi-final at Adelaide, it seemed bizarre that his promotion to open the batting for England's T20 team on a permanent basis in 2018 had been so controversial at the time.Buttler was in the crowd at Taunton as a young spectator during the 1999 World Cup when India's Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid thrashed what was then the highest partnership in ODI cricket. He was hooked. Somerset gained special permission from the ECB to add him to their Academy at 12, two years early, and he came to prominence as a 19-year-old in the 2010 season for Somerset, especially in the one-day arena where his clear-minded and quick-footed aggressive batting helped him to 440 CB40 runs at 55.00. He made his first-class debut against Lancashire at Taunton in 2009 and became a regular in the County Championship from May 2010 - playing a part in Somerset's title challenge that season. He combined in particularly potent fashion with Kieron Pollard in Somerset's run to Twenty20 Finals Day in both 2010 and 2011, and impressed in the 2011 CB40 final, making 86 from 72 balls in Somerset's defeat to Surrey.He made his international debut in late 2011 and became a fixture of England's T20 side. A first ODI appearance came against Pakistan in the UAE during the winter, though he had to wait almost a year for his second cap, this time as wicketkeeper. When Ashley Giles took over as limited-overs coach one of his first key decision was to ditch Craig Kieswetter for Buttler on a tour of India. With Kieswetter still preferred as Somerset's gloveman, it was that rivalry that caused Buttler to leave his beloved West Country and switch to Lancashire for the 2014 season. Lancashire saw him for 10 Championship matches, but it was soon apparent he would be making only fleeting visits in the future.England looked to him for impetus and increasingly he delivered, striking 99 against West Indies at North Sound and kicking off the 2014 ODI summer with a first hundred against Sri Lanka at Lord's as he led a failed run chase virtually single-handed. When Matt Prior became stricken by Achilles trouble - what proved to be a career-ending injury - the selectors gambled by throwing Buttler into the Test team. He scored five half-centuries in his first eight Tests, including 85 on debut against India at the Ageas Bowl, but his form faltered and he lost the gloves to Jonny Bairstow on England's tour of the UAE in 2015-16, during a period where his keeping started to make necessary improvements but his batting slip away.There were no such doubts about his place in the white-ball teams. His seniority was recognised when he was named Morgan's vice-captain for the 2015 World Cup and, although that tournament was an unhappy one for England, Buttler was a key member of the side that reached the final of the World T20 a year later. His dynamic batting was emblematic of England's one-day reinvention under Morgan, though he also began to demonstrate increased range to his game - when he led England to an extraordinary one-wicket win over Australia at Old Trafford in 2018, his unbeaten 110 from 122 balls was by far the slowest hundred of his career.Amid increasing demand on the T20 circuit, which included spells in the Bangladesh Premier League and Australia's Big Bash, Buttler's Test star seemed to be waning. He was briefly recalled in India in 2016-17 but then spent more than a year on the fringes, and was even overlooked as Bairstow's back-up during the following winter's Ashes tour. However, his stellar form for Rajashtan Royals in the 2018 IPL - he equalled the league record for consecutive fifties - prompted Smith to pick up the phone. Impressive contributions against Pakistan followed, and then, at long last, a maiden Test hundred, recorded in defeat to India at Trent Bridge. Suddenly, Buttler was integral in all three formats once again.He remained integral to the 50-over side building into the World Cup, and started the tournament itself in flying form with 103 off 76 balls in a defeat against Pakistan and a quick half-century against Bangladesh. But time at the middle was limited through the rest of the group stage, and England were so dominant in the semi-final against Australia that he was not required. In the final, his skill in run chases came to the fore: coming in with England wobbling at 86 for 4 in a chase of 242, he kept them alive with 59 off 60 balls in a 110-run stand with Ben Stokes, and while he could not see them home, he managed seven runs off three balls in the Super Over, and completed the run-out of Martin Guptill to win England the trophy.The highs of World Cup success were quickly forgotten, as Buttler cut a tired figure over the next six months. He struggled for runs in the Ashes and in South Africa, and with Bairstow and Ben Foakes breathing down his neck, it seemed a matter of time before he would lost his Test place. He responded with a breathless 75 off 101 in the home summer against Pakistan to seal a run chase at Old Trafford, before grinding out his highest Test score - 152 - in the final match of the series. By this stage firmly ensconced as England's T20I opener, he continued to lead from the front in their bid to hold both World Cups simultaneously.
ESPNcricinfo staffJos Buttler IPL factfile- Having made his IPL debut for Mumbai Indians (MI) in 2016, Buttler has become one of the most destructive batters in the tournament over the years.- Buttler was part of Mumbai Indians' title-winning side in 2017 before being signed by Rajasthan Royals (RR) in 2018- In IPL 2022, Buttler equalled Virat Kohli's record of four centuries in a season. And only Kohli (973) and Shubman Gill (890) have scored more runs in a season than his 863 in 2022.- In 2018, Buttler became only the second player after Virender Sehwag to hit five consecutive 50-plus scores in the IPL. David Warner joined the list in 2019."

Moeen Ali,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383100/383142.png",Chennai Super Kings,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batting Allrounder,"Moeen Ali was tipped for the top long before he won his Test debut at the start of 2014. But, after building a reputation as an elegant batter, it was his offspin bowling that earned him the call-up when England were left reeling from the surprise retirement of Graeme Swann.While many critics dismissed him as a ""part-time"" bowler, Moeen had a record to compare with the best in county cricket over recent seasons. And while he suffered more than his share of ups and downs, for the next five years he manfully carried the load in one of the most under-resourced areas of the English game. When he was dropped during the 2019 Ashes, subsequently losing his central contract, it turned out to be the beginning of the end for Moeen as a Test allrounder; nevertheless, on calling time in 2021, he finished just shy of 3000 Test runs and 200 wickets, making him England's third most-prolific spinner of all time.He was also a 50-over World Cup winner, as well as a regular at the IPL - his flair for fast scoring and utility as an allrounder encouraging the decision to focus solely on white-ball cricket ahead of the T20 World Cup in the UAE. Moeen admitted that he felt his batting had been ""wasted"" in Test cricket, where he featured everywhere from No. 1 to No. 9, but there will still moments to treasure, from an unbeaten hundred in his second Test to four centuries in the calendar year in 2016.He also managed a Test hat-trick, against South Africa at The Oval in 2017, during a series in which he took 25 wickets and scored 252 runs, and played a significant part in England winning the 2015 Ashes, as well as the 3-0 whitewash of Sri Lanka in 2018-19. A measure of his abilities as a Test bowler were his six dismissals of Virat Kohli - the last of which, in what turned out to be Moeen's final match, took him past Jim Laker's 193 Test dismissals.It was his batting that stood out during his early Test appearances. His outstanding 108 not out, spread over 6-and-a-half hours and 281 balls, against Sri Lanka at Headingley took England to within two balls of saving the series but, while he did unveil the first doosra bowled by an Englishman in a Test - developed after consulting Saeed Ajmal at Worcestershire - he initially struggled to offer his captain the requisite control in the field with his bowling.That changed in training for the Lord's Test against India. Encouraged by team-mate Ian Bell over the need to bowl quicker to survive in international cricket, Moeen benefited from a chance conversation from former Test offspinner Kumar Dharmasena, an umpire in the series and an onlooker at an England training session, who provided technical advice as to how to achieve the extra pace without losing any flight. It was to prove a pivotal meeting. Moeen was tighter at Lord's, devastating in Southampton and excellent at Old Trafford as he finished the series with 19 wickets; the fourth-highest haul any spinner had claimed against India in a Test series outside the subcontinent.Moeen had already made ODI and T20I debuts in the West Indies, before playing all four of England's games at the 2014 World T20. And while he struggled to recapture his batting form after that maiden century in Tests, he took his chance when promoted to the top of the order in the ODI side by hitting a 72-ball century in Colombo and ended the year a regular in all formats.Part of the team that failed abysmally at the 2015 World Cup, Moeen was also a key member of the revolution under Eoin Morgan, usually batting at No. 7 - from where he thrashed a 53-ball hundred against West Indies in 2017 - and providing spin back-up to his friend Adil Rashid. His captaincy skills also came to the fore, helping Worcestershire to secure a maiden T20 title and guiding Birmingham Phoenix into the final of the inaugural Hundred. In 2020, he became the first British Asian to captain England in a T20I.He had looked destined for such success for some time. Signed by Warwickshire as a 15-year-old, he made a century on first-class debut against Cambridge MCCU (he remains the second-youngest man to score a first-class half-century for the club) and Championship debut against Nottinghamshire but was dropped for the next game on both occasions. He also captained England Under-19s to the semi-final of the 2006 World Cup, blasted a 56-ball century in an U19 Test against Sri Lanka and, as a 14-year-old, smashed 195 not out in a Twenty20 match for his under-15 club side Moseley Ashfield. The next highest score was 11.But, frustrated by a lack of opportunity at Warwickshire during Mark Greatbatch's ill-fated reign as coach of the club, he left for local rivals Worcestershire at the end of 2006 and was a key part of the team that won the Pro-40 title in 2007. It included a 46-ball century against Northants in 2007; there had, at the time, been only one faster List A century made in England in matches involving two first-class counties.There were setbacks. Trying to combat a tendency to nick off, he went through a period of batting like Shivnarine Chanderpaul and then a spell of leaving balls that hit his off stump instead. But he made 1270 runs in 2010 and 1375 runs in 2013 - the year he won the PCA's Most Valuable Player award - as he augmented his flair with increased discipline. All the while, his offspin continued to improve.Moeen's development had a significance beyond the playing field. Taking on the mantle of role model for fellow British Asians - a sector of society that county cricket has not always encouraged as it might have done - he also talked eloquently of his Muslim faith and grew perhaps the most noticeable beard in English cricket since the days of WG Grace. He became known fondly as ""the beard that's feared"" at New Road.George Dobell"

He had watched Manchester City home and away growing up, but the move to the Caribbean inspired a desire to play cricket, and play it aggressively. He won a scholarship to play cricket at Reed School in Surrey, from where he was recommended to Keith Medlycott and joined their academy. He made a first-team debut in August 2015, but it wasn't until 2018 that he really broke through. Salt smashed two Championship hundreds from the top of the order - including 148 off 138 balls against Derbyshire - and a strike-rate of 172 in the Blast helped Sussex to the Blast final, which they might well have won but for his calamitous run out in the second over. He was talent-spotted by Lahore Qalandars, who invited him to play in the Abu Dhabi T20 trophy - a Champions League-lite - but Islamabad United swooped to sign him in the PSL draft instead. 2019 brought two more Championship hundreds, but again it was against the white ball that he impressed the most, smashing a ton in the One-Day Cup and finishing the Blast as Sussex's leading run-scorer. He answered a phone call from the Barbados Tridents from a Miami beach in October, and was soon flying into Trinidad to play in the CPL final - he made a duck, but lifted the trophy regardless. He also became a regular member of Adelaide Strikers' BBL squad, playing under his Sussex coach Jason Gillespie.The following summer might well have brought him an England debut after he smashed a 58-ball hundred against Ireland in a warm-up game at the Ageas Bowl but they stuck with their tried-and-tested openers and he returned to Sussex for the rest of the season. A winter away with Adelaide and Islamabad brought him limited success as teams worked out his vulnerability against legspin and when he returned to the UK, a freak cycling accident ruled him out of the early rounds of the Championship season. 2021 came to an end without him playing a single red-ball game and coincided with a move that felt like a homecoming: after spending midsummer playing for Manchester Originals in the Hundred, he signed a three-year deal with Lancashire as a replacement for Alex Davies.

He was retained for 2016 after being the most prolific six-hitter in the 2015-16 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.- IPL 2017 was his first proper season, playing 13 games and scoring 333 runs as Mumbai became champions for the third time. He was then released and picked up by Kolkata Knight Riders in the next auction.- KKR started using his skills as a bowler as well. He made a mark with the ball in their first game of the season, dismissing AB de Villiers and Virat Kohli off consecutive deliveries in a win against RCB.- Rana became an important part of KKR's middle order, due to his knack of going hard with the bat from the first ball. Rana also crossed the 300-run mark in every season since 2017.- In 2023, after new signing and newly appointed captain Shreyas Iyer was ruled out of the competition, Rana was made KKR skipper for the season. He ended it as his most prolific year, scoring 413 runs.Nitish Rana player profileAn aggressive left-handed batsman who bowls part-time offspin, Nitish Rana was one of the shining lights for Delhi in an otherwise dark 2015-16 season, which was plagued by off-field controversies. He struck 299 runs and 21 sixes - the most by any batsman in the tournament - in Delhi's run to the semi-final of the 2015-16 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. Out of the 21 sixes, eight came in an innings of 97 off 40 balls against Andhra.Rana made his List A and T20 debuts for Delhi in the 2012-13 season but played his first Ranji Trophy match only in the 2015-16 season. He had an impressive debut first-class season. He ran out Wasim Jaffer for a duck and made a half-century on debut against Vidarbha and finished the season as Delhi's highest run-getter, with 557 runs at 50.63, including a century and three fifties. Rana attributed his big-hitting prowess to his stint with Mumbai Indians. He was bought by the franchise in the 2015 auction for INR 10 lakh but did not play a game in the IPL 2015. He was retained by Mumbai Indians ahead of the IPL 2016 auction."

Firstly, that the game's formats had diverged so much that a man without a state contract or even a first-class appearance to his name could be worth such a sum; and secondly, that David had become one of the world's most sought-after T20 finishers over the previous 12 months.David, a powerful 6ft 5in middle-order hitter, was born in Singapore but raised in Western Australia, attending Scotch College, a prestigious school in Perth's leafy western suburbs. He was offered a state contract by WA in 2018-19 but never made the cut as a senior player. He took the rejection in his stride and threw himself into white-ball cricket, playing for Singapore - including at the T20 World Cup qualifier in 2019 - and winning sporadic opportuntiy for the Scorchers in the BBL.But his rise really started in 2020-21, when former WA bowling coach Adam Griffith lured him to Hobart Hurricanes. After a breakout BBL season, he was picked by Lahore Qalandars for the second half of the PSL: he kept performing, and contracts kept coming: for Surrey, Southern Brave, St Lucia Kings, RCB and Multan, then for Mumbai. In IPL 2022, he faced 86 balls and hit 16 of them for six, finishing the season with the best-ever strike rate for a batter in a single campaign (min. 50 balls) despite being dropped early on in the competition.David's opportunities have largely come as a finisher but he has occasionally batted at No. 3 and hopes to develop into a versatile T20 batter. He is a genuine power-hitter, particularly strong down the ground in the mould of Kieron Pollard, his team-mate at Mumbai Indians in 2022. After a stress fracture in his foot while on his rookie deal at WA, he switched from seam to spin and now bowls handy offbreaks, and is also a reliable fielder in the deep at long-on or midwicket.ESPNcricinfo staffTim David IPL factfile- Having built a reputation as a big-hitting finisher in the BBL, Tim David's first stint in the IPL was with Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in IPL 2021, but he got just one game that season.- Released ahead of the IPL 2022 mega auction, David attracted bids from as many as six franchises, finally going to Mumbai Indians (MI) for INR 8.25 crore.- In his first year with Mumbai Indians, David showed why he is so highly rated, striking at 216.28. His 46 off 18 against Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) was the highlight of the campaign for him.- IPL 2023 was not as good for David as his strike rate dropped to 158.22, but he was able to accumulate more runs, finishing with 231 runs at an average of 25.66.- Mumbai Indians kept faith in David and retained him for IPL 2024."

Armed with an anomalous, sling-arm action and natural pace, the peculiar release point of Bumrah's deliveries makes it hard for batsmen to pick him. Besides, like his Mumbai Indians team-mate, Lasith Malinga, Bumrah carved himself a reputation for possessing an uncanny ability to hit the blockhole. And, it was during his time in the IPL that he learned from the Sri Lankan to judiciously use the yorker.  A regular member of the India A team, Bumrah was on the fringes of national selection before a debilitating left knee injury at the end of 2014 kept him out for four-and-a-half months. He had to wait more than a year before earning another call-up, one which came on the back of a fruitful 2015-16 domestic season, where he was Gujarat's second-highest wicket-taker in the Ranji Trophy and topped the bowling charts in the Vijay Hazare Trophy - that included a five-for in the List-A final that gave Gujarat their maiden one-day title. Those performances, and an untimely injury to Mohammed Shami, meant Bumrah took the flight to Australia, where he played a central role for India, finishing as the highest wicket-taker from either side as the visitors swept the T20Is 3-0. It was a showing that earned him the praise of MS Dhoni - who called him the find of the tour - as well as a place in India's squad for the 2016 World T20.ESPNcricinfo staff Jasprit Bumrah IPL factfile- Jasprit Bumrah is one of the key players in Mumbai Indians' (MI) rise to becoming five-time champions in the Indian Premier League (IPL). He is their second-highest wicket-taker after Lasith Malinga.- Bumrah was spotted by MI after just one season of domestic T20 cricket and signed as an uncapped player ahead of IPL 2013. He played just two matches in his debut season and his first IPL wicket was that of Virat Kohli. His 100th IPL wicket, in IPL 2020, was also that of Kohli.- Since 2014, Bumrah has been a key part of the MI bowling unit and has grown to become its undisputed leader. With his unique action and high pace, Bumrah possesses a bagful of variations and a lethally accurate yorker, and is a force in every stage of the game.- Bumrah was MI's highest wicket-taker in three of their IPL title wins, taking 20 wickets in 2017, 19 in 2019, and 27 in 2020. He was also part of the squad when Mumbai won titles in 2013 and 2015, though he didn't play many games because he was new in 2013 and injured in 2015."

He top-scored for KKR in 2020 (440 runs) and once again in their run to the IPL final in 2021 (478 runs), but was not retained by KKR after the 2021 season.Shubman Gill player profileA right-hand top-order batsman from Punjab, Shubman Gill is known for his penchant for big runs and was hence drafted into India Under-19 side as the vice-captain for the 2018 World Cup. He made his first-class debut before that, for Punjab in the Ranji Trophy in late 2017 with a half-century in the game and an attacking 129 in the next match.A constant feature in Rahul Dravid's plans for the Under-19 World Cup, Gill constantly played at an age-group level above his. In 2014, he smacked 351 in Punjab's Inter-District Under-16 tournament, and shared a record opening stand of 587 with Nirmal Singh. On his Under-16 state debut for Punjab, he made an unbeaten double-century in the Vijay Merchant Trophy. Later that year, he went on to share the stage with his idol Virat Kohli while receiving a BCCI award for the best junior cricketer, which he won for two successive years: 2013-14 and 2014-15.When picked for the national Under-19 side, he amassed 351 runs in four innings to be named the Man of the Series during the Youth ODI series at home against England. In the reciprocal tour, his first in English conditions, he top-scored once more, with 278 runs in four innings. India swept both series.
While he was still in New Zealand for the World Cup on the day of the 2018 IPL auction, Gill was picked by Kolkata Knight Riders for INR 1.8 crore (USD 281,000 approx)."

Miller is a self-styled finisher who is strong off the front and back foot and eager to swing his arms, as well as a gun fielder. He made his first-class debut in 2008 at the age of at 18 and two years later, his international debut on South Africa's tour of West Indies. But it was only in 2013 that he became a regular at international level and it took another two years for him to get his first ODI century: 130 against West Indies in January 2015, followed swiftly by an unbeaten 138 two matches later, which sent him to the World Cup in good form. He made an 18-ball 49 in the semi-final that South Africa narrowly lost to New Zealand. Miller spent even longer waiting for a milestone in T20I cricket. His first fifty in the format came in March 2016. Both speak more to lack of opportunity in limited-overs cricket, rather than lack of ability. At the IPL, Miller was one of the mainstays of Kings XI Punjab for eight years, scoring over 350 runs in each season between 2013 and 2015 and captaining them in 2016. In 2022, he had his best IPL season, scoring 481 runs and striking at 142.72 in Gujarat Titans' title-winning campaign. David Miller IPL factfile- David Miller was for the longest time the face of Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings, or PBKS) after being brought in as a replacement player in IPL 2011 for US$ 100,000. He did not get a game that season but was retained by the franchise for IPL 2012 and stayed there till the end of the 2019 season.- In 2013 he smashed an unbeaten 38-ball 101 to help Kings chase down a target of 191 against RCB. He was named captain of the franchise ahead of IPL 2016 but was removed six games into the season after the team had a poor start.- Miller played two seasons with Rajasthan Royals in IPL 2020 and 2021 before being picked up by Gujarat Titans at the IPL 2022 mega auction.- Miller has breached the 350-run mark four times in the IPL. The 2022 edition was his best where he scored 481 runs in 16 matches at 68.71 - a key reason behind Titans lifting the IPL trophy in their debut season."

It wasn't plain sailing: that he played any international cricket at all is a credit to his mental toughness - at 16, he was diagnosed with testicular cancer, and required two cycles of chemotherapy to defeat the illness.He moved from Hobart to Melbourne when he realised he would be stuck behind Tim Paine in the Tasmania wicketkeeping queue. Victoria gave him a chance and he grabbed it, making 83 and taking six catches on his first-class debut. Wade would later become a Sheffield Shield-winning captain for Victoria, leading them to two titles in their hat-trick of wins between 2015 and 2017.Though he showed promise early in his Test career, including two hundreds in his first ten Tests, there was too much competition for the wicketkeeping spot. When his childhood friend Paine was handed the job for the 2017-18 Ashes, it looked like Wade had missed the bus, but he moved back to Tasmania, dominated state cricket for two seasons, and earned a spot for the 2019 series against England - in which he scored two centuries. That was followed by a return to the Australia white-ball set-ups. A brief, successful, stint as T20I opener in David Warner's absence, on the back of dominant BBL seasons as an opener with Hobart Hurricanes, made Wade Australia's first-choice T20I wicketkeeper in 2020-21, and he also captained the T20I team in two series while Aaron Finch was out. He was vice-captain for the 2021 T20 World Cup, and recast as a finisher. And it was in that role that he delivered arguably the most important innings of the T20 World Cup, in the semi-final against Pakistan to get Australia home, after which they went on to take the title."

He won the IPL title with Titans that season.- Before playing for Titans, Tewatia had been part of three IPL teams - Rajasthan Royals, Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals- It was during his second stint with Royals in 2020 that Tewatia shot to prominence, when he went from 9 off 18 balls to hitting five sixes in the final over to help chase down 224- Tewatia also bowls part-time legspin and has 32 wickets in the IPL, though he hasn't been used much since the Impact Player rule was introduced in 2023.Rahul Tewatia player profileStocky 29-year-old allrounder Rahul Tewatia burst into the IPL's consciousness in 2020, when, promoted to No. 4 by Rajasthan Royals in a chase of 224 against Kings XI Punjab, he crawled to 8 off 19 balls before turning into Mr Hyde and smacking five sixes off an over, taking his side to an unlikely win. A few games on, he produced an only slightly less impressive encore, lashing 45 from No. 7 in a chase of 159.That year was Tewatia's annus mirabilis. Nine of the 17 first-class wickets he had taken with his serviceable legspin in a sparse seven-game career for Haryana up until then came in a single match, against Jammu & Kashmir in February 2020. Two seasons on, he played a major hand for his new IPL side, Gujarat Titans, with three 40s that each took them to wins in their first year, where they finished as title-holders."
Rashid Khan,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383200/383228.png",Gujarat Titans,Right hand Bat,Legbreak Googly,Bowling Allrounder,"Rashid Khan player profileRashid Khan has been Afghanistan's first global superstar, and the key to their successes in their early years in international cricket. His extraordinarily effective legspin has made him one of the greatest T20 bowlers ever, among the first names on wishlists of teams in leagues all around the world. Not a big turner of the ball, he puts batters under pressure with his speed through the air, like his bowling idol Shahid Afridi, while maintaining a stump-to-stump line. His biggest weapon is an accurate googly, and he has variations aplenty. With bat in hand he is more than capable of clearing the boundary late in an innings, and he has airbrushed many a middling total into a match-winning one for his team. Rashid was just 17 when he made his ODI debut on Afghanistan's tour of Zimbabwe in October 2015. Less than two years later, he was snapped up by Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL for close to US$600,000. After a superb 17-wicket first season with them, he picked up franchise deals with Guyana Amazon Warriors - for whom he took the first-ever hat-trick in the CPL in 2017 - and Adelaide Strikers, with whom he won his (and their) first BBL title in 2018. He scaled new heights for Afghanistan as well, taking 5 for 3 in a T20I against Ireland to keep a record 11-match T20I winning streak alive, and later in 2017, taking his country to a win over West Indies in their first ODI in the Caribbean with 7 for 18. He was duly honoured as the 2017 ICC Associate Cricketer of the Year. The following year, he became the youngest cricketer to top the ODI bowling rankings, the youngest man to captain an international side, and the fastest to 100 ODI wickets.In Afghanistan's inaugural year in Test cricket, Rashid took five second-innings wickets in their first win, against Ireland, and six months later made an important fifty and took twin five-fors, finishing with 11 wickets in a famous win over Bangladesh in Chattogram. In 2021, he took 11 again, this time in a win over Zimbabwe. In his five seasons with Sunrisers, he was a totemic presence, taking 93 wickets at an economy rate of 6.33. When he moved to Gujarat Titans in 2022, he took 19 wickets in a run that led the side to the title.Rashid Khan IPL factfile- Rashid Khan became the first Afghan player to play in the IPL when he debuted for Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) at the IPL 2017 curtain-raiser.- After five seasons with SRH, he was snapped by Gujarat Titans (GT) in 2022, helping them win the IPL in their debut season. - In 2023, Rashid had his best season at the IPL yet, finishing second on the wickets charts with 27. On his way there, he registered the 22nd hat-trick in IPL history, dismissing Andre Russell, Sunil Narine and Shardul Thakur in three balls for Titans against KKR."

What makes his ascent even more remarkable is that he represents unglamorous Vidarbha in the Plate League of the Ranji Trophy. Yadav is the son of a coal-mine worker and was aiming to become a policeman. He only started considering a career in cricket as a 19-year-old, an age by which the best young Indian cricketers are in the running for a national cap. As a fast bowler, he has many skills: he regularly bowls at over 140kph, moves the ball both ways, and has a pretty effective bouncer. These qualities helped him take 20 wickets at 14.60 in four games for Vidarbha in his debut season in 2008-09. While he made waves in the domestic scene, Umesh really caught the eye during IPL 2010, where he impressed a much wider audience with his pace for Delhi Daredevils. He finally broke into the big league, when he was flown to the West Indies as a replacement for the injured Praveen Kumar during the World Twenty20 tournament in May 2010, and earned his first call-up to the India Test team for the tour of South Africa in November the same year. He made the Test playing XI for the first time against West Indies in Delhi in November 2011, and picked up nine wickets in his first two Tests, which in turn earned him a place for the Australia tour. On that tour, a disastrous one for India, Umesh was one of few positives for the side, outbowling his more experienced team-mates to finish with 14 wickets from four Tests and a strike rate of 50.50. More than his figures though, it was his speed and aggression that stood out. However, 2012 was an injury-prone year for him: he picked up a shin injury in Australia, before being ruled out one Test into the England series at the end of the year with back trouble. He returned to international cricket in June 2013 at the Champions Trophy in England, and a fast-bowler starved India would have heaved a collective sigh of relief to notice he had not lost his ability to bowl quick.After continuing in the ODI circuit, both home and abroad, Umesh was picked for the Australia Tests in 2014 and he followed that up by becoming one of India's frontline bowlers at the 2015 World Cup, finishing as the third-highest wicket-taker with 18 wickets at an average of 17.83.Siddarth Ravindran"

In his debut season Mohit had played just three matches when Haryana made an impressive run to the semi-finals, but during the 2012-13 Ranji season he emerged as one of the best fast bowlers in the country, finishing as the fifth-highest wicket-taker. Despite that, not many had seen or known about the youngster from Faridabad, who had been on the fringes ever since he rose through age-group cricket camps organised by the Haryana Cricket Association. But during the 2013 IPL, Mohit's talent was unveiled as MS Dhoni picked him consistently in the Chennai Super Kings XI. Not only that, he also gave him the new ball and Mohit responded handsomely. Standing at about 5'11"", Mohit has a smooth delivery stride, and though he is still working on his final landing movements with experts like Andy Bichel, he can consistently bowl at about 135 kph. Accuracy is his strongest suit, as he bowls a tight line and length regardless of the batsmen, pitch or ground conditions. In the IPL, his ability to bowl consistently in the channel around off stump stood out more than anything else. That allowed him to be one of the best Powerplay bowlers in the tournament. His consistent performances have been rewarded with a maiden call-up to the Indian team for their tour of Zimbabwe in July 2013. The rise continued in that series as he turned in a Man-of-the-Match performance on ODI debut.Nagraj Gollapudi"

By then he had a reputation in English cricket as a batter equipped with plenty of raw power and the ability to dismantle good bowling attacks, a sharp outfielder, and a useful spinner who could turn the ball either way.Livingstone first attracted attention when he creamed 350 in 138 balls for club side Nantwich in 2015 - one of the largest individual scores in any officially sanctioned limited-overs game.  He won a trophy that season when Lancashire took the NatWest Blast title, though he himself didn't do much of note (and needed stitches after he was attacked in a bar earlier during in the competition). By the time he topped the run-scorers' table at the inaugural Hundred in 2021 with 348 runs from nine games, Livingstone was something of a seasoned T20 campaigner, with experience in the PSL, IPL, BBL, and South Africa's Mzansi Super League. He was also one of MI Cape Town's early signings in the SA20 two years on.Livingstone made the England side for the 2021 T20 World Cup as their designated finisher, though he only faced a handful of balls in the tournament. His star rose higher still when he sold for Rs 11.5 crore (about US$1.5 million) in the 2022 IPL auction, to Punjab Kings. He delivered for them that season, with 437 runs - remarkably, most of them scored from No. 4, at a stratospheric strike rate - though his run-making tapered off with fewer starting opportunities in the two seasons after.Coming back from injury for the T20 World Cup in 2022, he was at the non-striker's end when Ben Stokes hit the winning runs in the final, against Pakistan. The following year, Livingstone made an unbeaten 95 in a big win against New Zealand in an ODI in Southampton."

Agarwal struck 432 runs at an average of 54 in five matches in the Under-19 Cooch Behar Trophy in 2008-09 and hit a match-winning 160 for India Under-19s, in a one-dayer against Australia Under-19s in Hobart in 2009.Agarwal was a bright spot in an otherwise disappointing Under-19 World Cup for India in 2010, top-scoring for his side in the tournament. Agarwal then graduated to the India A sides, but struggled for consistency.  Initially pigeonholed as a limited-overs specialist,  Agarwal made his Ranji Trophy debut for Karnataka in the 2013-14 season; he made his T20 debut in 2010-11 and List A debut in 2011-12. In the 2014-15 season, he was in the running to open for Karnataka in the Ranji Trophy, but was benched halfway through the season. According to Rahul Dravid, who worked with Agarwal in the India A side, it was a ""wake-up call"" for the opener. Agarwal lost weight in the off season, worked hard on his fitness, and scored his maiden first-class century the following season. He spent three seasons in the IPL with Royal Challengers Bangalore, from 2011 to 2013, scoring 492 runs in 35 matches, before moving to Delhi Daredevils in 2014.

Jansen went on to tour India with South Africa's Under-19 side in 2019 and, that season, was the leading wicket-taker for North West in the three-day provincial competition. He travelled with South Africa's Test squad to Pakistan in early 2021 and was signed by Mumbai Indians for the IPL.

It was the culmination of an extraordinary rise through the ranks: he was a late-bloomer, who made his first professional appearance aged 27 as a trialist at Northamptonshire, and had nearly quit the game altogether the previous winter due to injury.Gleeson proved himself an integral part of Northamptonshire's NatWest T20 Blast side in 2016. He missed Finals Day - their third in four years and one in which they emerged victorious - but he had done much to get them there, showing splendid economy levels, under six an over, with aggressive, full-length bowling and mastery of the yorker under pressure. It was all enough to win him a berth with Rangpur Riders in the 2016 Bangladesh Premier League.Northants' straitened financial circumstances meant that Gleeson, a former Minor Counties stalwart with Cumberland, played for them across all formats on a match-by-match basis in 2016, but he impressed enough to win a three-year contract at the end of the season. The following season, his coach David Ripley even called for England to give him a Twenty20 debut. The recommendation that went unheeded but in only a year he had made quite an impact.With that three-year contract complete, Northants' good work had invited interest from several higher-spending counties. Gleeson returned to Lancashire before the end of the 2018 season but the thought that he might help save them from relegation proved to be far-fetched. His parting gift to Northants was his best innings and match figures in first-class cricket - 6 for 79 and 9 for 95 respectively - against Kent at Canterbury. He then returned north to Old Trafford where he had once worked as a community coach and wondered if he would ever make the grade.His performances for Lancashire were enough to earn him further franchise opportunities, in the Abu Dhabi T10 and for Melbourne Renegades in the Big Bash, as well as call-ups to the England Lions squad for their tour to Australia in 2020 and to England's enlarged training squad later in the year. He suffered a stress fracture in his back on his return to county cricket, and a recurrence the following year which left him fighting for his future as a pro.In 2022, Lancashire signed him on a T20-only contract and he juggled training with teaching commitments at Myerscough College in Preston, where he worked part-time.

Before he had turned 21, Rabada had already established himself as a potential leader of the attack. Rabada thrust himself into the international spotlight at the 2014 Under-19 World Cup, where he took 6 for 25 against Australia in the semi-final. South Africa went on to win the title - their first - and Rabada finished as their highest wicket-taker.  Three months later, he was awarded a franchise contract with Lions and before the year was up, he had been included in the national ODI and Test squads. He made his T20I debut against Australia in Adelaide in November 2014.  In early 2015, Rabada showed his ability in the longer format. He claimed the South African record for the best bowling figures in a first-class match, 14 for 105, surpassing the haul taken by Dale Steyn seven seasons before. He finished the season as the third-highest wicket-taker in the Sunfoil Series. He was included in all three squads to tour Bangladesh in July-August 2015, and became only the second player to take a hat-trick on ODI debut, eventually finishing with the best figures by a first-timer: 6 for 16. Rabada also played in a home series against New Zealand and was then included on a tour to India. There, he led the ODI wicket-takers' list with Steyn after both claimed 10 wickets. Injuries to Morne Morkel, then Steyn and Vernon Philander, meant Rabada got a chance to play in three of the four Tests of that series. On inhospitable pitches, he worked hard, often without reward but displayed the stamina required of a Test bowler. Rabada has had more assistance from the surfaces at home, where he played against England in the absence of Steyn and Philander. In the final Test, with South Africa having already lost the series, Rabada became the youngest South African to take 10 wickets in a match when he finished with 13 for 144. His workload did not lessen as he played a further four ODIs and two T20Is against England, three T20Is against Australia, and also led the attack at the 2016 World T20 in India. After his performances, Rabada seemed primed for an IPL stint but chose to sign a county deal with Kent for a month instead.  Firdose MoondaKagiso Rabada IPL factfile- Rabada's rapid rise in international cricket earned him an IPL deal when he was just 21. He was bought for INR 5 crore by Delhi Capitals (then Daredevils) in 2017.- He played six games that year, returning as many wickets and missed the next season with injury.- Retained in 2019 for INR 4.2 crore, Rabada went on to bag 25 wickets in 12 games. The next year, he finished as the season's highest wicket-taker, taking 30 wickets as Capitals finished runners-up. - He was released ahead of the IPL 2022 mega auction and was then snapped up by Punjab Kings for INR 9.25 crore.- In his first season with Kings, he claimed 23 wickets even as the team failed to make the playoffs. He only played six matches in 2023 and was retained for IPL 2024."

He then went to CSK in 2011 and stayed there till 2013.- It was with Kings that Saha had his most successful time - in 57 matches for them, he scored 1115 runs at an average of 24.77.- Saha's most impressive performance with the bat was in the IPL 2014 final where he smashed an unbeaten 55-ball 115 for Punjab Kings against KKR, but it was not enough to take his team over the line in what remains their only appearance in an IPL final.- After being with Kings for four seasons, Saha moved to SRH before being snapped up for INR 1.9 crore at the IPL 2022 mega auction by GT. Saha's most successful IPL season so far has been with GT - 371 runs in 17 innings at 23.11 in 2023.- Saha has also effected more than 100 dismissals behind the wickets in his IPL career - 112 before the start of IPL 2024.Wriddhiman Saha player profileWriddhiman Saha was drafted into the Bengal Ranji side after regular wicketkeeper Deep Dasgupta signed up with the Indian Cricket League. He grabbed the chance with both hands, becoming the 15th Bengal player to score a hundred on Ranji debut. Though he managed only one more fifty in the remaining first-class games of the season, he was signed up by the Kolkata Knight Riders for the inaugural season of the Indian Premier League. He scored 318 runs in five games in the 2009-10 Ranji season and was picked in the squad for the first Test for the home series against South Africa. A last-minute injury to Rohit Sharma handed Saha an unexpected debut in Nagpur - as a batter.His second Test appearance - against Australia in Adelaide in January 2012 - was also somewhat accidental, a result of MS Dhoni's suspension due to India's slow over-rate. In between, Saha played two ODIs against New Zealand, but was mostly seen as India's reserve wicketkeeper on overseas tours.  Dhoni's retirement from Test cricket after the Boxing Day Test against Australia in Melbourne in 2014 opened the doors for Saha, who had long been an understudy, to firm up his position in the team.Cricinfo staff May 2014"

Particularly strong off the pads, and with a fondness for driving on the up, Shankar made scores of 111, 82, 91, 103 in the Ranji Trophy knockouts to finish with 577 runs at 57.70 that season, after returning from a groin injury.He was subsequently rewarded with an India A call up and made an unbeaten half-century on debut against an Australia A attack comprising Gurinder Sandhu, Andrew Fekete, Sean Abbott, and  Steve O'Keefe. Shankar also impressed against South Africa A and aimed to become a genuine allrounder, instead of a batsman who can bowl part-time.As a teenager Shankar had honed his skills on his terrace, which doubled up as a make-shift indoor net, with his father and brother Ajay, who played lower-division cricket in Tamil Nadu. Shankar bowled offspin until he was 20, but switched to medium-pace in a bid to break into a spin-heavy Tamil Nadu side.At 21, he was handed his first-class debut against Vidarbha in Nagpur, where he scored 63 not out and took two wickets. He had to play understudy to a settled middle order, before his breakthrough season in 2014-15. He had to play understudy at Chennai Super Kings in the IPL as well, getting just a solitary game over three seasons. He was then bought by Sunrisers Hyderabad in the 2016 IPL auction.Deivarayan Muthu"

He began to feature more regularly from 2019 onwards, as one of a number of promising young Irish seamers coming through at the same time, and was awarded an emerging player contract that year.In 2020, he was key performer in Ireland's T20I victory against West Indies in the Caribbean, taking 3 for 29 while defending 208, and took five wickets in two ODIs against England later that year.ESPNcricinfo staff"

In one night, the 19-year-old went from being Karnataka's next big Ranji hope to entering the record books as he hit his way to the highest Twenty20 score by an Indian. That century also meant he would not have to carry out his intention of following his father into the army if he did not make it as a professional cricketer.But his barnstorming start did not immediately translate into an India call-up and Pandey continued to work his way up in the domestic circuit. His growth as an aggressive middle-order batsman and an athletic fielder coincided with Karnataka's rise as undisputed leaders of the domestic arena in a period that saw them complete the double treble. In July 2015, six years after that smash-mouth IPL hundred in Centurion, Pandey made his international debut in Harare.Pandey's breakout international innings, however, came six months later in Sydney. In January 2016, his unbeaten maiden ODI century helped India gun down Australia's 330 with two balls to spare and prevent a whitewash. While Pandey was not included in any of the T20 competitions India played in the lead-up to the World T20, he was brought in to replace an injured Yuvraj Singh in the semi-final against West Indies, where Pandey did not bat.

He was picked by Chennai Super Kings (CSK) ahead of IPL 2018 and has been with the franchise since then.- Before the start of IPL 2024, Chahar sat at No. 5 on CSK's list of all-time top wicket-takers, with 71 wickets in 68 games at a strike rate of 20.5.- IPL 2019 was Chahar's best season, when he picked 22 wickets in 17 matches finishing third on No. 3 on the Purple Cap list. - Chahar was the second-most expensive buy at the mega auction ahead of IPL 2022, with CSK buying him back for INR 14 crore. A back injury, however, ruled him out of the entire season.- Chahar has been a three-time IPL winner with CSK in 2018, 2021 and 2023.Deepak Chahar player profileDeepak Chahar is a classical swing bowler who added T20 smarts to his game to pick up 6 for 7 against Bangladesh in 2019, then the best bowling figures in T20Is. After making a sensational first-class cricket debut for Rajasthan in 2010-11, taking 8 for 10 in Hyderabad's 21 all out, Chahar struggled with injuries and fitness. He then rediscovered himself as a T20 bowler, blossoming under the captaincy of MS Dhoni in Chennai Super Kings' triumphant return to the IPL in 2018. He did even better next season, finishing third on the wickets table, with 22 at a strike rate of 17.5, including 3 for 26 in the final. Super Kings paid US$1.8 million to keep him at the 2022 auction. However, a back injury ruled him out of that season's IPL and from the T20 World Cup, for which he was in the reserves, later in the year.A bowler in the mould of Praveen Kumar and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Chahar learned swing bowling at his father's coaching academy. Dhoni used him shrewdly with the new ball, often bowling him for three overs in the powerplay. Chahar also kept working on his other skills and turned himself into a capable bowler at the death, which was evident in that record-breaking spell against Bangladesh: four of his six wickets, including a hat-trick, came with a wet old ball in dewy conditions.Chahar is also a handy lower-order batter. In an ODI in Colombo in July 2021, he steered India's chase with an unbeaten 69 from No. 8."

He got admitted to the BCB's pace foundation and soon caught the coaches' attention to make the Bangladesh Under-19 side for the 2014 World Cup. He made his first-class debut for Khulna in the 2013-14 season and, after taking eight wickets in the U-19 World Cup in the UAE, he was surprisingly picked for Bangladesh A's tour of West Indies. Returning from that short trip, he was viewed as a better bowler and slowly picked up more variations. He initially lacked pace but built it up through the 2014-15 first-class season, when he took 26 wickets at an average of 19.08. This was when Mustafizur started to develop the left-armer's offcutter, which was delivered as a spinner does but with the added ability of making it carry to the wicketkeeper standing back. The story of Anamul Haque's dare that got him to bowl the delivery will go into Bangladeshi cricket folklore, as will the early support he received from Mashrafe Mortaza, who spotted him randomly in the Mirpur nets.Soon enough, the Bangladesh selectors picked Mustafizur for the one-off T20I against Pakistan and then, midway through 2015, for the ODI series against India when he became only the second bowler after Brian Vitori to take five-wicket hauls in his first two ODIs, paving the way for Bangladesh's first-ever ODI series win over India.He was excellent in bilateral series against South Africa - which included a Test debut - and Zimbabwe, while also doing well in his first BPL campaign. Mustafizur's first foray on to the world stage was through the IPL auction, when he was picked Sunrisers Hyderabad in early 2016, followed by confirmation of a contract with Sussex for English domestic limited-overs cricket. He ensured none of his new paymasters doubted their call as he emerged as one of the best bowlers in the World T20, signing off with a five-wicket haul against New Zealand, bamboozling them with his variation of cutters.

An efficient allrounder - a strong middle-order batsman who can bowl flighted offspin - Nabi's rise, like Afghanistan's, has been staggering. He has been at the centre of the side since their time in the ICC's World Cricket League Division Five, from where Afghanistan began their rise to the international stage.Nabi took up cricket at the age of 10 while living in Peshawar. Honing his skills with endless sessions of tennis-ball cricket, he managed to begin training at Arshad Khan's academy in Peshawar and made his competitive debut against Rahim Yar Khan Cricket Association in Pakistan's erstwhile Cornelius Trophy in 2003, making 61 after having just met most of his team-mates. On a tour of India he caught Mike Gatting's eye with a century against a visiting MCC side. That brought him more valuable experience with MCC, for whom he made his first-class debut, and he went on to play a major role in Afghanistan's progress to the World Cup Qualifiers in South Africa in 2009. Nabi struck 58 against Scotland on one-day international debut and 102 in his first first-class game for Afghanistan, against a Zimbabwe XI.Nabi has remained the backbone of the side that qualified for the World Twenty20 in 2010, 2012 and 2014 and, recently, the 2015 World Cup. Nabi has had a couple of stints as Afghanistan's captain, taking over the role from Nawroz Mangal in March 2013 and leading the side to the 2015 World Cup. He has overseen rapid changes in Afghanistan's cricket but has remained calmer than most.

He achieved the feat in a game against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) off Shivam Mavi in 2021.- DC - the only IPL team Shaw has been a part of - retained him despite a torrid IPL 2023, where injuries and poor form meant he played just eight games.Prithvi Shaw player profilePrithvi Shaw shot to prominence as a 14-year old when he scored 546 off 330 balls, an innings that contained 85 fours and five sixes, for his school Rizvi Springfield in the Harris Shield, an age-group cricket tournament in Mumbai in 2013. Shaw's innings was then the highest score in school cricket. In November 2016, Shaw was part of the India Under-19 squad that won the youth Asia Cup in Sri Lanka. Two months later, he made his Ranji Trophy debut for Mumbai in the semi-final against Tamil Nadu and scored a second-innings century that led his team to victory.In September 2017, at 17, Shaw became the youngest player to score a century on Duleep Trophy debut, a record previously held by Sachin Tendulkar. He was then named captain of the Under-19 World Cup squad, a tournament India went on to win. During the tournament, he was sold to Delhi Daredevils for INR 1.2 crore (USD 187,500 approx) in the 2018 IPL auction.Given an opportunity after their IPL campaign flagged midway, Shaw impressed head coach Ricky Ponting with his fearless batting against the new ball; ending with 245 runs in nine innings at a strike rate of 153.12. However, it was his performances for India A, both in England and at home against West Indies A and South Africa A, that gave wings to his India aspirations. He pipped Mayank Agarwal in the race to be India's back-up opener when he earned a call-up for the fourth and fifth Tests in England in 2018, and finally became India's 293rd Test cricketer in Rajkot against West Indies in November 2018 after India's selectors ran out of patience with Shikhar Dhawan. Shaw marked the occasion by becoming the youngest Indian Test centurion on debut, and just the second-youngest Test centurion for India after Sachin Tendulkar."

However, with two giant spinners - Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh - at the peak of their powers, there wasn't a place available for him in India's squad.Mishra made his international debut in 2003 during an ODI triangular in Bangladesh, but he had to wait until 2008 to get his first go in Tests. That opportunity came after an injury forced Kumble out of the Mohali Test against Australia. Mishra had a dream start to his Test career, becoming the sixth Indian to take a five-wicket haul on debut, foxing the Australians with his variations and finishing the series with 14 wickets from three Tests. With his debut series coinciding with Kumble's last, it was the opening he needed to establish himself as India's first-choice legspinner. But, his inability to extract turn on benign pitches and the lack of accuracy were his failings as other spinners overtook him in the pecking order. Mishra's struggles in international cricket aside, he has remained a vital cog for the Haryana Ranji side over the years, collecting a bagful of wickets. But, it's his performances in the IPL, where he has been one of the best spinners, and the only bowler to pick up three hat-tricks, that keep him in the limelight. The hat-tricks came for three different teams - Delhi Daredevils (2008), Deccan Chargers (2011) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (2013). In 2015, Mishra returned to the team he first played for, with Daredevils paying INR 3.5 crore to secure his services.A strong display in the 2013 IPL, during which he kept the batsmen guessing with his variations in flight and pace, earned him a call-up for India's ODI squad for the Champions Trophy in England and the tour to Zimbabwe, almost two years after his last international appearance. He didn't disappoint, picking up 18 wickets at 11.61 in five ODIs against Zimbabwe, and equaling Javagal Srinath's record for the most wickets in a bilateral series. Mishra's good form continued into the World T20 the following year in Bangladesh, where he picked up 10 wickets at 14.70, while only conceding 6.68 runs per over, as India adopted a three-spinner strategy and finished runners-up to Sri Lanka.With younger options thin on the ground, India recalled Mishra to the Test side for their 2015 tour of Sri Lanka. Playing Tests after a four-year gap, he complemented R Ashwin perfectly, picking up 15 wickets in three Tests at 15. The re-emergence of Ravindra Jadeja during the 2015-16 home series against South Africa restricted Mishra's involvement to only two of the four Tests, but he performed creditably on spin-friendly pitches, his seven wickets at 17.28 including the dismissals of AB de Villiers (twice), Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis and JP  Duminy.

His first season at the club was disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, though he bowled impressively throughout the T20 Blast to take Lancashire to the semi-finals. In 2021, he swung the red ball impressively and cracked a Championship hundred from No. 8 against Kent. Wood made great strides in 2015, alongside two other Nottinghamshire quicks, Brett Hutton and Jake Ball, playing 11 Championship matches, taking 30 wickets, and earning a place on an ECB fast-bowling camp in South Africa. He also lodged a maiden Championship hundred, against Sussex, in only his eighth innings, off 96 balls, an innings replete with wild flails that gave way to resounding connections, and rescued Notts from 98 for 7.  Wood's director of cricket, Mick Newell, rated the century the ""most remarkable I have ever seen in first-class cricket"".

That earned him an ODI debut in March 2019 as well as call-ups to the IPL and the 50-over World Cup, although injury sidelined him from the latter two tournaments.
Later that year, he got the chance to make his Test debut in India, and his ability to bend his back on the docile tracks stood out even as South Africa slumped to one Test defeat after another. His first away five-for in Tests also came in the subcontinent, in Rawalpindi in early 2021. Back home against England in December 2019, Nortje proved himself the find of the summer, challenging England's batters with plenty of short stuff and finishing as the leading wicket-taker with 18 in four Tests even though South Africa lost 3-1. His ability to grind it out as a nightwatch - contributing to a match-winning partnership in Centurion and batting for over three hours in Port Elizabeth - prompted South Africa's bowling coach Charl Langeveldt to nickname him a ""proper Dutchman"". In the 2020 IPL, Nortje, playing for Delhi Capitals, clocked 156kph on the speed gun, and although Jos Buttler ramped that delivery for four, Nortje returned to bowl one of the balls of the tournament - a 155kph rocket that moved in off the seam and took out Buttler's middle stump. An improved legcutter added to his T20 variations, helping him take nine wickets at an economy of 5.3 in the 2021 T20 World Cup. Hip and back injuries shortened his 2022 IPL, but he remained a strike force for South Africa across formats, playing the summer Tests in England and the 2022 T20 World Cup in Australia, where he was the fifth-highest wicket-taker, with 11 dismissals from five games, again at an economy of 5.3, including 4 for 10 against Bangladesh.He was named the men's cricketer of the year at Cricket South Africa's awards in July 2023 - an honour he had won in 2021 as well - but disappointingly missed the 2023 ODI World Cup in India and the entire summer at home due to a stress fracture to his back.Nortje was schooled at Brandwag High in the small town of Uitenhage, north of Port Elizabeth and went on to complete a degree in financial planning at Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, where he used varsity cricket to hone his skills. He enjoyed a strong start to his first-class franchise career, with 20 wickets in four matches in the 2016-17 season and a fifth-place finish on the first-class wicket charts in the 2017-18 summer. But the shortest format was where he got his big break.Anrich Nortje IPL factfile- Anrich Nortje was bought by Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) at the IPL 2019 auction for his base price of INR 20 lakh but a shoulder injury ruled him out that season.- Nortje was released by KKR ahead of IPL 2020 and initially went unsold at the auction. He was then signed up by Delhi Capitals (DC) as a replacement player for Chris Woakes.- Nortje made an immediate impact with his pace, clocking speeds in excess of 155kph on more occasions than one. Nortje finished IPL 2021 with 22 wickets, the fourth highest that year.- Nortje didn't play the first half of IPL 2021, which was held in India, but had an excellent second half when the tournament resumed in the UAE, taking 12 wickets in eight games with an economy rate of 6.16.- Nortje was retained by DC ahead of the IPL 2022 mega auction. An injury restricted him to just six games in IPL 2022 where he picked up nine wickets. - Nortje didn't have the best of times in IPL 2023, managing just ten wickets in as many games and leaking runs at 9.10."

Sundar loved to bowl but only in matches because he found it boring to just field. He eventually started to take it seriously under the eye of former India offspiner M Venkataramana.

He took 22 wickets at an average of 18.22 in his first Ranji Trophy season, as Karnataka claimed the 2013-14 title, and followed it up with a hat-trick against Rest of India in the Irani Cup. Those displays spurred Mumbai Indians to bag Shreyas for his base price of INR 10 lakh in the 2014 IPL auction.Sharp turn rather than accuracy is Shreyas' forte, and Karnataka have tended to use him in short bursts rather than over long spells. While he has consistently chipped in with wickets, his technically correct batting - which brought him two hundreds in his second Ranji Trophy season - seems likely to become his primary suit over time.

In 2022, he grew in both white ball codes at international level, registering the best ODI figures for an Englishman with 6 for 34 against India at Lord's. A sucker-punch came on the eve of that year's T20 World Cup when he rolled his left ankle, rupturing the ligaments, after stepping on a boundary sponge during a fielding drill ahead of England's final warm-up match. He was subsequently ruled out of the tournament. At a skyscraper height of 6ft 7ins, Topley has always towered above his team-mates. An early developer, he first hit the headlines in 2009 when, as a 15-year-old net bowler, his favourite player Kevin Pietersen drilled a drive into the side of his head. He needed stitches but Pietersen left him a signed bat as a more welcome memento.It wasn't until 2011 that Topley started making his own headlines. As a gangly 17-year-old left-arm seamer with huge potential he took 14 wickets for Essex in his three opening Championship matches - including five-wicket hauls in each of his first two games against Kent and Middlesex. That season was interrupted as Topley had to return to Royal Hospital School in Suffolk to start revising for the summer exams. His father, the former Essex player Don, was his school teacher and cricket mentor so slacking in any department was not an option. Topley seemed admirably unaffected by the early hype. At the Under-19 World Cup in Australia in 2012, he stood out as a professional in a boys' game: no one claimed more than his 19 wickets, which came at nine apiece, and Topley relished his status as a senior bowler in England's side. Further recognition - before he had even turned 19 - arrived with an England Lions call-up for the 2013 tour Down Under.The ECB and Essex have been careful to manage his workload, the county rotating him with their other talented quicks. He was a key member of the team in 2013, taking more than 80 wickets in all formats to earn a place on England's Performance Programme trip to Australia. However, a back injury ruled him out of going to Sri Lanka with the Lions, a reminder of how young fast bowlers need protecting.Topley had played for Essex representative sides since the age of nine, but immediately after his England debut in a T20I against Australia in 2015 he announced he was on his way, citing a lack of ambition. Instead, he headed for Hampshire, whose success in the limited-overs game was undeniable. He impressed in the white-ball series against Pakistan and South Africa in the 2015-16, and kept his spot for the World T20 in India despite a chastening outing against AB de Villiers in a T20I immediately before it. But he leaked runs in a high-scoring game against the same opposition in the tournament itself, and was left out for the rest of England's run to the final.But injury struck again, this time in more freakish fashion, in his first season with Hampshire. He failed to bowl a ball after being ruled out for the season during his debut when his left hand was broken when he was hit by a bouncer while batting against Warwickshire's Boyd Rankin. Shoulder surgery followed in the close season and then he suffered another back stress fracture in August 2017 in a season in which he had managed only 112 overs in all competitions. Topley signed a white-ball only deal in 2018 and won an England Lions call-up against India A as a show of faith, allowing him to show some neatly-timed form just ahead of the Royal London Cup final, but he was not selected, and soon needed a pin in his back after a fifth stress fracture. He signalled his wish to move on and was released in September.Sussex took a gamble on him during the 2018-19 winter, allowing him to train and recover at Hove, and he recovered to take 17 wickets in their T20 campaign and play his first Championship games for two years at the end of the season. They were unsurprisingly keen to tie him to a new contract, but were gazumped by Surrey, who became his fourth county when he signed at the end of the season.ESPNcricinfo staff"

For several seasons in the mid 2010s, spinners were among the leading wicket-takers in South Africa's first-class competition. Maharaj was among them in the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons and was rewarded with an international call-up the following summer.In his youth, Maharaj was a pace bowler, whose father played for Natal B during segregation years. He turned to spin on a whim in the nets one afternoon at school. He found that it worked and stuck to it. Maharaj's secret was his accuracy. At the Dolphins, he was able to combine that with an ability to take wickets at key moments.During the opening first-class match of the 2016-17 season, Maharaj picked up 13 for 157, and was then told he would be on South Africa's Test tour to Australia. Maharaj debuted at the WACA, an unusual place for a spinner, given the conditions, but did a remarkable job. In an innings in which he had to hold one end when Dale Steyn was injured, Maharaj bowled well enough to allow the other two seamers to be rotated at the other side. He took 3 for 56 in the first innings, four in the match, and scored an unbeaten 41 to show great promise for the future.Firdose Moonda"

No Indian has led more than two teams.Shikhar Dhawan player profileShikhar Dhawan stunned all observers, and Australia, when he stroked his way to the fastest Test century by a debutant. That debut, in Mohali in 2012-13, came to Dhawan in his ninth year of first-class cricket after he had been written off by almost everybody, not least because India's opening combination had been fixed to the most prolific combination in their Test history: Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir.Dhawan is one in a long line of stroke-players from Delhi, which became the Indian batting capital in the 2000s. He stands upright in his stance, is a bit stiff with his hands when he pushes forward, and is partial to the cover-drive. Those who played domestic cricket with him say he is supremely confident, bordering on showmanship. He is also a flamboyant personality with his ever-changing looks and the twirled moustache.However, the attractive strokes, which were apparent even in the 2003-04 Under-19 World Cup where he was the Player of the Tournament for scoring 505 runs at 84.16 with three centuries, didn't seem to translate into huge seasons in Ranji Trophy. His average stayed steady in the mid-40s, but he didn't quite dare the selectors to overlook him. After lukewarm showing in the IPL and five ODIs, and with the Test openers going well, it seemed Dhawan would be left consigned to domestic cricket and T20 leagues.Fortune turned, though, and both Sehwag and Gambhir lost form dramatically, giving Dhawan a chance at the age of 27 with 81 caps and 5679 first-class runs to his name already. Dhawan grabbed the chance with arguably the best debut by an Indian batsman, smashing 187 off 174 balls to set up India's win in a Test that was reduced to four days. He was picked in India's squad for the Champions Trophy soon after, and carried his sizzling form into that tournament with two centuries in the side's first two matches.Dhawan's form later tailed off in England and Australia in 2014 but he hit back with 412 runs at 51.50 in India's run to the 2015 World Cup semi-finals.

He is not a teenage prodigy, nor is he someone who had a burning ambition to play for his country. He journeyed through from his adolescence to adulthood and stumbled upon the sport he sometimes played as a child, only to discover he is quite good at it.Born in Sialkot in the northeast of Pakistan, Sikandar had told his parents when he was 11 years old that he wanted to be a fighter pilot. He wrote the exam that got him into Air Force college. He was one of 60 to have won a place among 60,000 applicants. But in his third year, he failed an eye test. He was told that 7 out of 10 people have the problem in normal life, but for him a dream was shattered.Not dissuaded, Sikandar got admitted to Glasgow Caledonian University, where he picked up cricket as a semi-professional. He moved to Zimbabwe, where his parents had resided since 2002, and he made his first-class debut in 2007. He made one half-century in nine innings before completing his studies and returning to full-time cricket in the 2010-11 season. He had a more fruitful time, scoring 625 runs at an average of 41.The following season was again decent as he developed a reputation as an aggressive top-order batsman. Sikandar kept doing well in the one-day and Twenty20 competitions at the time, so it was natural for the selectors to turn to him for a practice match against the visiting Bangladeshis in 2011 when Vusimuzi Sibanda was injured. He did well, and it became clear that he had a future in Zimbabwe colours.Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) began a process to get him the necessary papers that would qualify him to play for the country and in May 2013, he made his international debut for Zimbabwe, in the first ODI against Bangladesh, thus becoming the 116th player to appear for Zimbabwe in the format. Four months later, he made his Test debut too, against Pakistan in Harare. By the time the 2015 World Cup rolled around, Sikandar was firmly settled into his role as the most adventurous batsman in Zimbabwe's top order, with a fondness for carving the ball through - and sometimes over - point, and a useful side line as an offspinner. He played a pivotal role in one of Zimbabwe's most memorable moments on a cricket field, winning the deciding ODI against Sri Lanka with a crucial cameo in a pressure situation chasing 204 on a turning track in Hambantota in July 2017. Before batting, he had helped restrict Sri Lanka in that game with what was his best figures in ODI cricket: 3 for 21 in 10 overs. The result? Zimbabwe had won a five-match ODI series away from home for the first time.Mohammad Isam"
Kane Williamson,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383100/383172.png",Gujarat Titans,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Top order Batter,"Kane Williamson player profileBy the time Kane Williamson is finished with playing cricket, it is probable that he will be New Zealand's greatest batsman. Even Martin Crowe endorsed that view. But he may also finish as one of the game's most loved global figures. Williamson is ambidextrous, bats right-handed in the top order across formats, and has become a pillar of the New Zealand side since he made his debut in 2010.Williamson was born into a sporting family in Tauranga, the largest city in New Zealand's Bay of Plenty region. His father had played Under-17 cricket for Northern Districts, his mother was a representative basketball player, and his sisters played volleyball at age-group level. Williamson took to cricket and it grew beyond a hobby quite quickly.He was modest about his skills, too, - ""Everyone is gifted, I guess, but you get some that seem exceptionally so. I'm not one of them,"" - yet Williamson was billed to make it since he was 14. He scored a century on Test debut at the age of 20, and at 24 years and 151 days he was the youngest New Zealand batsman to 3000 Test runs- younger than Don Bradman too.At the crease, Williamson is comfortable against pace and spin, and he trusts the coaching manual explicitly despite the mutation of batting in the Twenty20 era. Among his best performances is his maiden Test double-century in January 2015, which helped New Zealand come from behind and beat Sri Lanka in Wellington. The innings was a testament to Williamson's hunger for runs and batting time - he was dissatisfied despite making 242 in over 10 hours.Williamson has made his orthodoxy work and is capable of scoring at a brisk tempo - he has a T20 hundred for Northern Knights and became the quickest New Zealand batsman, and fifth overall, to 3000 ODI runs. For a measure of his consistency, he has two streaks of five or more successive fifty-plus scores in ODIs in 20 months since 2014.He is rarely drawn to emotion and is a genial, but hard, competitor - Williamson once struck the winning six in a roller-coaster, one-wicket win over Australia in the 2015 World Cup, and celebrated with a smile and the calmest of fist pumps as Eden Park exploded in raucous jubilation. Williamson is also an outstanding catcher and a part-time offspinner, though he needed to remodel his bowling after being banned from bowling in international cricket in June 2014 for an illegal action.With the mental strength to match his skills, Williamson was an automatic choice to take over the captaincy at the World T20 in 2016, soon after the retirement of the inspirational Brendon McCullum. Williamson led the team to four back-to-back victories in India, and was highly praised for his tactics that helped the team adapt to slow, turning pitches, before they were beaten by England in the semi-final.In 2018, Williamson led New Zealand to two famous Test series wins. In April, he became the fourth New Zealand captain to win a series against England. In December, he was the chief architect of New Zealand's first away Test series win over Pakistan in 49 years, with 89 and 139 in the final Test. He became the first New Zealander to score 20 Test centuries in 2019 with an unbeaten double century against Bangladesh at home. But he elevated himself into the global pantheon of greats at the 2019 World Cup, where he was not only named player of the tournament but he carried himself with unprecedented class as the trophy was snatched from New Zealand's hands by England in the greatest final of all time. He made two match-winning centuries against South Africa and West Indies and a vital 67 in a famous semi-final win against India to get New Zealand to a second successive World Cup final. His captaincy and calmness among the mayhem of a tied final and tied Super Over was extraordinary. His conduct in the aftermath having lost the Cup on a one-off tie-break provision where the team with the most boundaries wins, was even more incredible.
Alagappan MuthuKane Williamson IPL factfile- Kane Williamson became the first New Zealand player to win the orange cap in the IPL when he scored 735 runs for Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in 2018. At the time, he was only the fourth overseas batter to score over 700 runs in an IPL season after Chris Gayle (twice), Michael Hussey and David Warner. - Williamson's tally remains the fifth-highest in an IPL season behind Virat Kohli (973 in 2016), Shubman Gill (890 in 2023), Jos Buttler (863 in 2022) and Warner (848 in 2016).- Williamson also holds the record for the third-most runs in a season as captain, behind Kohli and Warner (both 2016). - Williamson led SRH to the final of IPL 2018 where they lost to Chennai Super Kings (CSK). Overall, he captained SRH in 46 matches, the second-highest behind Warner's 67.- Williamson has been part of two champion squads, SRH in 2016 and Gujarat Titans (GT) in 2022, but didn't feature in the final in either of those years."

A small man with a whippy, fast arm action and an ability to swing the ball at speeds of 140kph he provides a different trajectory in all three formats. However, his impressive start was halted by a dislocated shoulder during an ODI against Pakistan in the UAE ruled him out of World Cup and Ashes contention in 2019 with further injury setbacks hitting his progress over the following years.Having made his one-day debut for Western Australia at the age of 19 in 2015-16, and his Sheffield Shield debut later that season, Richardson was a surprise selection in Australia's T20I squad to play Sri Lanka in February 2017. His call-up came on the back of a productive BBL season in which he collected 11 wickets, and most notably was Player of the Match in the final, when he ran through the Sydney Sixers middle-order to help Perth Scorchers to the title. At the time of his national selection he had played only one first-class game.From there his progress was rapid. After a good finish to the 2017-18 season where he made his ODI debut against England, he was taken on the infamous Test tour of South Africa and then injuries to the big three paved the way for a national contract and limited-overs tours of England and Zimbabwe. After some tough experiences at the hands of the England batters, he returned to Australia and dominated the Sheffield Shield to get himself back in Australian colours. He took Virat Kohli's wicket three times in three ODIs against India and then made his Test debut against Sri Lanka in February 2019 where he took five wickets in the match at the Gabba. Two years later he returned to the Test side against England in Adelaide where he claimed a maiden five-wicket haul before injury kept him out of the rest of the series.

Mitchell Marsh,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316612.png",Delhi Capitals,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Allrounder,"Mitchell Marsh player profileMitchell Marsh, one of the most well-known surnames in Australian cricket, had been an alluring prospect for many years but struggled to cement a place across formats. However, that has changed in recent years, starting in T20 and then taking in ODIs and, perhaps most significantly, Test cricket.The first of the breakthroughs came when he was elevated to No. 3 in the T20I side and went on to play a vital role in winning the 2021 World Cup. Then he became a more settled, and increasingly dominating prospect, in the one-day team which brought more glory at the 2023 ODI World Cup in India.Earlier that same year during the Ashes in England he had made a remarkable return to the Test side at Headingley with a powerful opening-day century at Headingley. A productive home summer followed and in early 2024 he was named the Allan Border Medalist, while a few months later was named T20I captain.Marsh was earmarked for high honours, alongside his brother Shaun, ever since he captained Australia Under-19s to victory in the 2010 World Cup in New Zealand. He played state cricket at just 17, and made his T20I debut at 19 in 2011. He was also a promising junior Australian Rules footballer, and hails from a prolific sporting family - his father is Geoff Marsh, the Australia opener, and later coach and selector; his sister, Melissa, was a professional basketballer.In 2018, Marsh was appointed Australia Test vice-captain in the wake of the ball-tampering scandal, but he was then dropped from all formats and lost his national contract due to a string of failures, at Test level in particular. In 2020 he returned to the T20I fold and the following year, starred on two tours of West Indies and Bangladesh then produced a stunning 77 not out off 50 balls in the T20 World Cup final.Marsh made it to the Test side over Shane Watson on the 2015 Ashes tour and was given time to settle into the No. 6 role, although his bowling was arguably the stronger feature of his game at the time. That had not been the case in his debut Test series, against Pakistan in the UAE the previous year, when he scored 87 and 47 in his second Test. He never quite settled until a big century at the WACA in the third Test of the 2017-18 Ashes. He followed that with another, in Sydney - brought up amid emotional scenes with his brother at the crease - and then made a pivotal match-winning 96 in a Test win in Durban before Australian cricket plunged into crisis.It was the start of a period of decline for Marsh too. He only played one Test during the 2018-19 home summer, failing twice with the bat against India at the MCG. He returned as part of the Ashes squad in 2019, at The Oval, where he took his maiden five-wicket haul. Later that year, he broke his hand thumping the dressing-room wall at the WACA following a dismissal in the Sheffield Shield, disrupting his career again before the revival began.Mitchell Marsh IPL factfile- For all his big-hitting prowess, Mitchell Marsh has had an underwhelming IPL career so far. Injuries haven't helped. Marsh has been involved in the IPL since 2010 but is yet to have a season where he has played all the games for his franchise. - Marsh has turned out for five franchises in the IPL - Deccan Chargers, Pune Warriors, Rising Pune Supergiant, Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Delhi Capitals (DC).- Marsh was first picked in 2010 by Chargers as a 19-year-old. He managed just 28 runs in three games and picked up two wickets. Warriors then splurged US$290,000 for Marsh in the 2011 auction. He played two seasons for Warriors in 2011 and 2013 (he missed the 2012 season because of a back injury). - Between 2014 and 2021, Marsh was part of the IPL in just two seasons. He played three games for Supergiant in 2016, and then a solitary match for SRH in 2020 before getting injured. - Marsh has been more regular since being picked in the IPL 2022 mega auction for a hefty sum of INR 6.5 crore (US$866,000) by DC. He had his best season with the bat in 2022 when he scored 251 runs in eight matches with a top score of 89.- Marsh had an underwhelming IPL 2023 with the bat but picked up 12 wickets at 14.16 - the most for a DC bowler that season. He returned home mid-way through the 2024 season to recover from an injury."

In his teens he gained a reputation as one of the fastest bowlers on the school circuit, which carried over into the 2016 Under-19 World Cup, where he bowled the competition's fastest delivery, a 147kph zinger that broke Zimbabwe batter Brendan Sly's stumps. Joseph would finish as West Indies' highest wicket-taker of the tournament, with 13 wickets from six games at an economy of 3.31.He had made it into the U-19 World Cup squad on the back of his first-class performances - in his second season with Leeward Islands in late 2015, he took his first five-for, against Guyana, and followed it up with 7 for 46 against Windward Islands in the next match. His 24 first-class wickets that season and the World Cup performance saw him fast-tracked into the Test side; he debuted against India at Gros Islet in August 2016 and bounced out Virat Kohli for 3 for his first wicket. His ODI debut came a few months later, against Pakistan in Sharjah. In 2019, Joseph was signed by Mumbai Indians as an injury replacement for Adam Milne, and in his first game, against Sunrisers Hyderabad, he returned figures of 6 for 12, the best figures by a bowler in the IPL."
Ricky Bhui,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_h_100_2x/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/314800/314834.jpg",Delhi Capitals,Right hand Bat,Legbreak Googly,Top order Batter,"Ricky Bhui began his career with seven 30-plus scores, including three half-centuries, in his first nine innings at the Under-19 level in 2013. He was integrated into Andhra's Ranji Trophy side the same year.He then made a sparkling 79-ball 103 not out on List A debut in the Vijay Hazare Trophy and followed it with a fifty on T20 debut. However, things took a drastic turn, as poor form saw him lose his place in the Under-19 side. However, Sunrisers Hyderabad bought him in the 2014 IPL auction for INR 10 lakhs (approx. $16,500). ""If I can get an opportunity to make a mark for Sunrisers, it would be like icing on the cake,"" Bhui had said.Even though he hasn't got that chance in the IPL as yet, his franchise retained his services ahead of the 2016 auction after he scored two tons in three Ranji Trophy games in 2015. He also played for India in the 2016 Under-19 World Cup in Bangladesh. ESPNcricinfo staff"
